    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t<p>As we move into 2022, the demand for the rapid and constantly improving digital experience is bolstering. To match the demands of the market, brands are now adopting the DevOps culture for streamlining the deployment, development, management, and maintenance of software.</p>\n<p>This blog covers everything that you should know about DevOps Technology, what are its seven components, the top DevOps best practices of 2022, and the benefits of DevOps. Read to know more.</p>\n<p><strong>What is DevOps Technology?</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>DevOps is the combination of philosophies, cultural practices, and tools that increases a business\u2019s ability to deliver services and applications at high velocity. The DevOps model helps in improving a particular product at a faster pace than organizations that utilize traditional software development and infrastructure. This speed enables businesses to serve their customers in a better way and compete more efficiently in the market.</p>\n<p>Under a DevOps model, the operations and development teams are no longer siloed. Sometimes these two teams merge together into a single team where the engineers work across the application life cycle and get involved right from development and testing to deployment and operations. Then they develop a range of skills that are not just limited to a single function. In a few DevOps models, security teams and quality assurance may also become more tightly integrated with the operations and development or throughout the application life cycle.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What are the Top 7 Key Components of DevOps?</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>The seven key components of DevOps include:</p>\n<p><strong>1. An Agile Framework</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Agile is a well-known approach for managing software projects. It was basically developed to speed up the process of development by dividing the IT projects into small chunks. Project requirements are reviewed during this entire project life cycle process in order to respond to the changes quickly.</p>\n<p>While DevSecOps makes use of similar development principles as agile, like the continuous integration and delivery of software systems (CI/CD) in iterations, they actually differ when it comes to handling security.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>2. Build and run development</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>DevOps makes use of container technology, which radically transformed the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies. There is a semi-mutual agreement in the DevOps community to ignore wasting time in the developing &amp; testing environments for certain platforms.</p>\n<p>For example, the DevOps developers utilize container technology for writing code, building, running, and testing without bothering much about the operational resources. This, in turn, leaves enough time for the operations team to focus more on security and testing.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>3. Everything-as-code</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Incorporating security into code is crucial in developing software projects. For creating secured applications, the DevOps tools and workflows must be secured. This could be achieved by integrating the security policies and adding checks and tests to the code without bringing in extra costs or delays during the actual process of code writing.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>4. Communication and collaboration</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Having a clear communication channel during the entire development process is important for the successful completion of the project. In DevSecOps, there are three teams that are responsible for developing the final product. This includes the operations, development, and security teams.</p>\n<p>Each team considers work to outperform the rest. The operations and development team focus on delivering project iteration on time. The responsibility of the task management is to close the collaboration and communication gap. This can be done by encouraging the teams and making them aware of the importance of the security framework in the delivery of a secured product.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>5. Automation</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Automation plays a vital role in the successful integration of securities into the DevOps model. For example, by automating the manual process and building tools into CI/CD pipelines, the operations and development teams can together work closely and function as a single team, thereby boosting their ability to respond to the security team inquiries.</p>\n<p>Automation can boost the task of implementation of security during a project development process by speeding up the feedback loop. It will also speed up the design process as well as to detect the security problems, including the compliance issues.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>6. Regular Integration</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Integration is all about sending applications to a situation where they will connect with other components and applications in an ecosystem. Having a customary timetable for implementing your application is crucial in accomplishing a feedback cycle. The moment the integration cycle becomes tighter, so will the feedback cycle.</p>\n<p>Therefore, every time someone needs to make the cycle tighter, they need to automate a step or process that is manual. Some of the examples of manual advances that should be automated include testing, deployment of the application, reporting issues, and troubleshooting.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>7. Value Stream Management (VSM)</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>VSM works on boosting the flow of value in the entire delivery lifecycle of particular software. DevOps through VSM ensures that the customers\u2019 value becomes the mainstay of software product development. The business needs to have control and transparency of many integrated value streams within the portfolio scope.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>DevOps Best Practices of 2022</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Below mentioned are the best practices of DevOps:</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>1. Continuous Integration</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Continuous integration is a type of software development practice when the developers regularly merge their code changes with the central repository, after which the build-up of automation happens and the test serving runs.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>2. Continuous Delivery</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Continuous delivery is also another type of software development that expands with the continuous integrations and deployment of all code changes.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>3. Microservices</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Microservice architecture is a kind of design approach which is used for building single applications as a set of small services. Each service runs based on its own process and communicates with other services via a well-defined interface like an HTTP-based Application Programming Interface (API).</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>4. Infrastructure as Code</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>The Infrastructure as Code is a typical practice where the infrastructure is provisioned using code and software development techniques. This includes continuous integration and version control. Engineers can interface with the infrastructure by utilizing the code-based tools and treat the infrastructure the way they treat the application codes.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What are the Benefits of DevOps?</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>If you are wondering what the benefits of DevOps are, then there are many. DevOps have always been praised for shortening the development cycles of a particular product. This has ultimately created a better experience for both the end-users and the organizations. Below are some of the advantages of DevOps that you will experience while implementing it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unites teams and ships software faster</li>\n<li>Simplifies the development focus</li>\n<li>Introduces automation to the entire development process</li>\n<li>End-to-end responsibility</li>\n<li>Ensures faster deployment</li>\n<li>Stabilizes work environment</li>\n<li>Significantly improves the product quality</li>\n<li>Promotes agility in business</li>\n<li>Reliable and fast problem-solving techniques</li>\n<li>Minimal cost of production</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>DevOps is all about a particular journey that embraces all the practices of building a proper product. The DevOps apparatuses and aptitudes are ceaselessly advancing. To remain competitive and to move ahead in today\u2019s environment, one needs precision. DevOps helps the teams focus on the customer experience, simplifies the goals, unites teams for faster product shipments, introduces automation, and creates feedback loops that benefit the entire company.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Build a thriving career by becoming a DevOps engineer</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Combining the technical know-how along with the critical operational and communication skills, DevOps is a flourishing IT philosophy that can transform an organization\u2019s ability to deliver seamless applications.</p>\n<p>As a tech phenomenon, it is also now a strong career option that has opened a wide range of opportunities for professionals within the IT industry.

If you are dedicated to making the best of your data science interview preparation, this is the right place for you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Data Science Interview Key Questionnaires for Freshers</strong></p>\r\n<p>Among the most popular data science interview questions asked throughout a screening process are as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. What is Data Science?</strong><br>A set of methods, algorithms, and machine learning techniques that enable you to uncover hidden patterns in raw data.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. What is logistic regression?</strong><br>The use of a linear combination of predictor variables to predict a binary outcome.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Describe three different types of sample biases.</strong><br>Three sorts of biases: selection, coverage, in survivorship.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. How does supervised learning work?</strong><br>The algorithm in supervised learning learns from labeled training data and aids in the prediction of unexpected data outputs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. How does unsupervised learning happen?</strong><br>Unsupervised learning is primarily concerned with unlabelled data. Conclusions are formed from datasets with input data that is unlabelled.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Explain the mechanism of logistic regression.</strong><br>A mechanism for determining a binary result from a linear function of predictor factors is logistic regression.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Define decision trees.</strong><br>Decision Trees are a subtype of Supervised Machine Learning in which data is continually separated based on a parameter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8. What exactly is a recall?</strong><br>The true positive rate divided by the actual positive rate is the recall.</p>\r\n<p><strong>9. Explain the normal distribution.</strong><br>The mean, median, and mode all have the same values in a normal distribution.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10. Is it possible to gather the relationship between categorical and continuous variables?</strong><br>To capture the relationship between categorical and continuous data, we can apply the analysis of covariance technique.</p>\r\n<p><strong>11. Is it possible to make a stronger prediction model by considering a parameter as a continuous variable?</strong><br>Only if the parameter is ordinal should the categorical value be considered a continuous variable. Hence, it is a more accurate model.</p>\r\n<p><strong>12. What do you mean by random forest?</strong><br>A random forest combines the results of numerous decision trees to produce a more accurate and reliable prediction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>13. Decision Tree or Random forest?</strong><br>A decision tree may be more precise than a random forest on a given training data set. The random forest always wins in terms of accuracy on an unexpected validation data set.</p>\r\n<p><strong>14. Examine the Decision Tree algorithm.</strong><br>A decision tree is a well-known supervised machine learning technique for classification and regression.</p>\r\n<p><strong>15. Describe why data cleansing is necessary.</strong><br>Dirty data frequently leads to erroneous internal information, which can harm an organization\u2019s prospects.</p>\r\n<p><strong>16.

Hence, it becomes necessary to know the type of institute, affiliation, accreditation, and degrees conferred by the education institutes. Besides, parameters like institute recognition bodies should also be taken care of. Whether recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) or other recognized professional councils as per the rules of the Government.</p>\r\n<p>You must have come across the terms \u2018autonomous institute\u2019 quite often. But have you tried what does autonomous college mean? Well, the majority of the students don\u2019t have much idea and clarity about the differences between difference between autonomous and non-autonomous institutes.</p>\r\n<p>Intrigued to learn what is meant by the autonomous college? Let us take a deep dive into this blog, which will help you understand the concept of what is meant by autonomous college and reveal the difference between autonomous and non-autonomous institutes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is Autonomous College?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As per the recent rules and standards of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), any college having in India obtaining a score of 3.51 or any score ranging between 4 is considered as an Autonomous college.</p>\r\n<p>However, colleges that are accredited in three or more programmes which are having a score of 750 or above in every programme suitably and certified by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) automatically declare an institute with an autonomous status by UGC. The autonomy status is generally granted by UGC after the recommendation of a NITI Aayog Committee (a public policy decision-maker of the Government of India).</p>\r\n<p>In other words, Autonomy can be explained as the privilege granted to selected colleges imbibing high standards and eminence to develop a career cum industry-centric curriculum. Moreover, Autonomous colleges in India enjoy a couple of good benefits. Let us find out those exciting benefits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of Autonomous College in India</strong></p>\r\n<p>Autonomous colleges are granted freedom to control their daily operations, syllabus, courses offered, and admission procedure. An autonomous college will be affiliated to not one, but multiple universities. Autonomous colleges are affiliated to/recognized by any Government body and fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education (DHE), MHRD. However, they follow their own regulations, academic programs, and grading system instead of following the university\u2019s norms and syllabus. The benefits of autonomous colleges are numerous that are specifically focused on the betterment of students\u2019 overall development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Salient benefits of autonomous college:</strong></p>\r\n<ul style=\"display: table;\">\r\n<li>Autonomous colleges enjoy more academic independence to change courses and syllabus.</li>\r\n<li>They exercise independent control over their daily operations, curriculum, exams, and admission process.</li>\r\n<li>They have the authority to decide their own syllabus, evaluation patterns and conduct their own exams.</li>\r\n<li>Degrees are mostly awarded by affiliated universities.</li>\r\n<li>After the completion of a degree or diploma course, the certificate is issued by the affiliated university the college is associated with.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Difference Between Autonomous and Non-Autonomous College?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Being a student, do you know what does autonomous college mean? Or the major difference between autonomous and non-autonomous colleges? For students, who are still not very sure of how differently these two academic bodies operate, mentioned below are a few key differences between autonomous and non-autonomous colleges:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Autonomous College</th>\r\n<th>Non-Autonomous College</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Have academic independence</td>\r\n<td>Do not have academic independence</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Granted permission to autonomously award degrees.</td>\r\n<td>These affiliated colleges cannot grant degrees.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Can design their own curriculum, syllabus and conduct examinations.</td>\r\n<td>Follow the syllabus and curriculum prescribed by the affiliated universities.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>The curriculum is flexible and is outlined by the Board of Directors and educationists to cater industry -student needs.</td>\r\n<td>Relaxed &amp; flexible curriculum. And designed by the university members.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>The examination rules &amp; pattern is followed strictly. They are laid down by the college itself, hence has more command and holds over the question papers.</td>\r\n<td>The question papers are set by the guidelines of the university committee.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>A relative grading system is followed.</td>\r\n<td>Mostly Traditional percentage system is followed.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>The admission procedure is easy and more student-friendly. No much paperwork and hassles involved.</td>\r\n<td>The admission is mostly based on entrance exams or on the merit system. Therefore, it is quite difficult to get into these colleges.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong>NIET: 1<sup>st</sup> Private Institute in UP to Get Autonomous Status by UGC</strong></p>\r\n<p>NIET Greater Noida is the 1st Private Institute in Uttar Pradesh that has received autonomous status by the renowned UGC, New Delhi.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>In this competitive era, preparing yourself for campus placements is the most pivotal part of education. Earlier, most of the students ignored the significance of the campus placements and waved goodbye to the opportunities of getting selected by the company. But now, every year, you can observe hundreds of students taking active participation in the campus placement process.</p>\r\n<p>One of the advantages of campus recruitment is the assurance of stable job profiles in reputed companies. In India, the majority of campus recruitment companies often lower their hiring criteria for entry-level employment. However, if you are applying through an Off-campus or Pool campus placement drive. In that case, there\u2019s much more than technical knowledge required to clear the interview as the scale of competition increases.</p>\r\n<p>So, moving forward, here in this blog, you will get to know what is campus interview, what is campus recruitment and its types, the importance of placement, comparison between on-campus vs off-campus, campus recruitment process and most important campus placement preparation tips.</p>\r\n<p><em>First, let us understand what is placement in college.\u00a0</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is Campus Placement/Campus Recruitment?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Campus Placements/ Campus Recruitment drives are conducted in various educational institutes for providing job opportunities to the students. Campus Recruitment allows students to earn a safe and secure future. Keeping in mind the importance of the placement, it is vital for a student to prepare adequately for these programs and ensure that they put their best foot forward.</p>\r\n<p>Campus recruitment is a strategy for sourcing, engaging, and hiring young talent for internship and full-time job roles. College placement is a tactic for leading companies to hire high-volume qualified candidates. The campus recruitment process often involves collaboration with colleges, career consulting &amp; services centres, third-party agencies, attending job fairs, and more.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the Types of Campus Placement?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are sure you all will be aware of what is campus interview is. But, are you well informed about the type of campus placement?</p>\r\n<p>In general, there are mainly two types of campus placements that can be classified under the existing campus placement models. They are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>On-Campus Placement:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In On-Campus placement drives, recruitment companies are officially invited on the college campus to conduct interviews to gauge their potential as future employees. The placement process is centralized. Before the interviews, they make a selection on criteria like student\u2019s knowledge, technical abilities, and zeal to work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Off-Campus Placement:</strong></p>\r\n<p>As the name defines, it is a type of placement conducted outside the college campus. In Off-campus placement, the role of college is absent. This means that there are no rules and regulations of the college, and seek employment on your own. Reputed companies conduct pool placement interviews where students from different colleges assemble at a commonplace.</p>\r\n<p>Students who have failed to get an on-campus placement can get a career opportunity through this type of placement. Here, an individual need to take a lot of effort to find their perfect employment fit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pool Campus Placement:</strong></p>\r\n<p>This type of campus placement considers a specific affiliation criterion. The concept of the pool campus placement enables a student to attend campus interviews held at colleges that are affiliated with the same university. Pool Placements adds an advantage for the students of the colleges to join the combined placement drives, which are similar to on-campus drives with a larger scale. Here, one gets to explore a lot of career choices to opt for.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On-Campus Vs. Off-Campus Vs. Pool Campus Placement</strong></p>\r\n<p>The ultimate purpose of the placement drives is to hire candidates that fit the organization\u2019s requirements. However, every college campus recruitment has its own pros and cons.</p>\r\n<p>If you talk about on-campus vs. off-campus recruitment drives, on-campus placement focuses on saving your time, provides you limited competition that increases the higher success probabilities, dedicated assistance from the respective college placement team that guarantees placement. Whereas, in off-campus recruitment, one gets to explore an infinite range of opportunities without any interference from the college and feel a sense of self-achievement after getting placed. Apart from pros, off-campus has a few cons, like facing more challenges during the placement process and limited career prospects.</p>\r\n<p>Pool campus placement paves the way for creating larger talent; therefore, there are higher chances for selection. As this approach encourages the participation of a number of colleges and students, it brings diversity to the company as a whole. On the other side, Pool campus placement involves a large number of participants, which makes appropriate evaluation of the real talent difficult. So, this approach requires detailed planning and precision to manage this placement process efficiently.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Objectives of The Campus Placement</strong></p>\r\n<ul style=\"display: table;\">\r\n<li>To identify the talented and qualified students in the college.</li>\r\n<li>To create promising career opportunities for students in reputed corporate companies.</li>\r\n<li>To select candidates who are suitable for the current job roles without any biased behaviour.</li>\r\n<li>To provide roles and duties as per the student\u2019s knowledge, expertise, and interest.</li>\r\n<li>To ensure students start a career and move forward in the right direction for better quality living.</li>\r\n<li>To provide ultimate satisfaction to students by offering the companies of their choice according to their eligibility.</li>\r\n<li>To provide career guidance through counselling and interactions with industry experts.</li>\r\n<li>To evaluate and select the right candidate to meet the organization\u2019s requirements.</li>\r\n<li>To identify the professional traits, real-time skills, and values within the students.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://niet.co.in/blog/covid-19-challenges-and-opportunities-for-the-youth/\">COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities for the Youth</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Why is Campus Placement Important?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Campus recruitment plays a critical role in student\u2019s life. Nowadays, the significance of campus placement has gradually become an integral part of an institute\u2019s offerings. Campus recruitment not only benefits students but the recruitment companies as well. It is one of the suitable techniques to select the best-qualified candidate for the organization.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, the advantages of campus recruitment are also experienced by the students. It acts as a concrete platform that helps aspirants to achieve their professional career goals. It allows students to unleash prospective opportunities to start off their careers in the right direction. Further, it also helps to strengthen their long-term career foundation.</p>\r\n<p>In the present era, students pay special attention to placement assistance and records while selecting an institute for admission.</p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in to get a clear understanding of the importance of Campus Placement:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Students are offered prestigious job roles in a reputed organization before completing the degree.</li>\r\n<li>Helps the recruiters to find the right fit for the organization without wasting time.</li>\r\n<li>Formation of a cordial relationship between the company and the college.</li>\r\n<li>The chances of selection in campus placements are high in comparison to off-campus and pool placements.</li>\r\n<li>It builds a bond of loyalty and commitment between the college and the students.</li>\r\n<li>Recruiting partners get an opportunity to explore the skill-based technical and non-technical talents within the students.</li>\r\n<li>Students get to directly contact recruitment team members.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/importance-of-employability-skills-2\">Importance of Employability Skills</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the Process of Campus Placement?</strong></p>\r\n<p>What is a campus interview? To provide you with a clear understanding, here is a general recruitment process flowchart:</p>\r\n<h4>1. Pre\u2013Placement Discussion</h4>\r\n<p>This is the first step of the placement process. The pre-placement discussion includes a presentation briefing the company\u2019s profile, selection procedure, vision and mission, and major accomplishments. After providing the crucial details of the company, recruiters might ask questions with regard to their company merely to check how attentive you have been during the discussion.</p>\r\n<h4>2. Written Test</h4>\r\n<p>Most of the companies conduct a written test. The written examination may differ based on the positions you are applying for, your academic performance, or your education streams. In general, the written test includes a few aptitudes, English, and technical-based questions. Few companies in addition to this also conduct personality or psychometric tests.</p>\r\n<h4>3. Group Discussion</h4>\r\n<p>This round is usually included in the interview procedure to evaluate the communication and presentation skills of the candidates. A common topic is given, and students are asked to discuss it. Once the discussions begin, students are judged on their knowledge, communication skills, confidence, leadership qualities, and listening ability, professional etiquette, and convincing power. Many companies prefer this step to filter out the less eligible candidates, hence also known as the elimination round.</p>\r\n<h4>4. Technical Interview</h4>\r\n<p>After the elimination round, students undergo a technical round in which their technical skills are scrutinized. Candidates are asked questions by an individual or panel to understand their technical competency. Depending on the job profile, the technical interview can be short or long duration.</p>\r\n<h4>5. HR Interview</h4>\r\n<p>HR or Formal interview is the last phase of the campus recruitment process. It can be either an individual HR round or combined with an expert. Primarily, this round is considered the final round of the selection process. Where the more you are updated and confident, the more will be your chances of selection. Basically, here you are evaluated on the basis of your overall personality and abilities.</p>\r\n<h4>6. Post\u2013Placement Discussion</h4>\r\n<p>After the selection, the candidate will be receiving the offer letter. You will be shared important information on the company\u2019s guidelines related to the joining process, the company\u2019s policies, and other valuable information that you need to know. In the case of campus placement, usually, your institute\u2019s placement cell takes care of your offer letter and joining formalities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://niet.co.in/blog/how-placement-drive-at-niet-institute-helps-students-to-achieve-job-success-from-successful-employability-program-at-niet/\">How Placement Drive at NIET Institute Helps Students to Achieve Job Success from Successful Employability Program</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tips to Crack Campus Placement Interview\u00a0</strong></p>\r\n<p>Finding a job can be a tough challenge in today\u2019s time.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t<p>\u201cThe science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs\u201d<br>\nArtificial Intelligence is one of the world\u2019s highly advanced topics. The AI research firm <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a> is working hard these days to help us acknowledge AI\u2019s ability and the issues that society needs to address on this fascinating topic. They are trying to ratify the road to secure artificial general intelligence, a significant shadow. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an informatics branch. It involves the creation of computer programs that would require human intelligence to complete tasks otherwise. AI algorithms can tackle learning, cognition, problem-solving, language and logical reasoning, digital data processing, bioinformatics, machine biology, etc.</p>\n<p>In the contemporary world, AI is used in several respects. AI algorithms, for example, are used in Google searches, Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine, and route finders for GPS. Many Robot Control AI programs are not included. By using AI to control robots, AI algorithms are just part of the broader robotic network, including sensors, actuators, and programming other than AIs.</p>\n<p>AI has become such as integral part of our life, we cant imagine our life without it. We using AI well driving to the office searching for restaurant, news updates, shopping online and even for recommendations on social media. Accorning to a Gartner report AI estimated to paved the way 2.3 million opportunities by the year 2020. Also vancies in the field about AI have doubled over the last 3 years. And the career opportunities existing in private companies, public organizations, health care industy, education and govt. Institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Applications of AI (Robotics)</strong></p>\n<p>The most exciting area of robotics is arguably artificial intelligence (AI). Robotics is a technology branch that specializes in physical robots. Robots are programmable machines typically capable of performing a series of actions autonomously or semi-autonomously.<br>\nAI helps to save the movements that a robotics system makes, while improving them continuously, making installing and moving robotics systems simple enough for anyone. Robots are now being used in retail stores and hotels around the world, in a customer service capacity. AI provides a computer vision for the robots to navigate sense and calculate their reaction accordingly. Robots learn to work by machine learning from humans there, which is again part of computer programming. It\u2019s time to set it right once and for all.</p>\n<p><strong>There are three main factors which make up a robot:</strong><br>\n1. Robots interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.<br>\n2. It\u2019s programmable for robots.<br>\n2. Generally, robots are independent or semi-autonomous.</p>\n<p>The link between robotics and AI is that of artificially intelligent robots. These are robots powered by programs running AI. If you want to let the robot perform more complex tasks, AI algorithms are required.</p>\n<p>To travel around the warehouse, a robot in warehousing can use a path-finding algorithm. If the battery is about to run out, a drone could use autonomous navigation to return home. A self-driving car may use a combination of AI algorithms to identify potential road hazards and avoid these. Those are all examples of artificially intelligent robots.</p>\n<p><strong>Applications of AI (Nanotechnology)</strong><br>\nAlthough nanotechnology incorporates physics, chemistry, and engineering expertise, AI has relied heavily on biological inspiration to create some of its most successful patterns, such as natural networks or evolutionary algorithms. Bridging the connection between current nanoscience and AI can boost research in these disciplines and provide a new generation of information and communication technologies that will have a significant impact on our society. Nanotech powered computer hardware could surpass the GPU and lead to breakthroughs in today\u2019s Deep Learning press. Imagine nano-enabled hardware with capabilities beyond the development by IBM of the world\u2019s first artificial phase-change neurons, or the Nervana acquisition by Intel.</p>\n<p>AI may be using nanotechnology to create foods, including substitution and restoring human organs. This may have drastic consequences for life-extension, for all humans or the wealthy.<br>\nThe intersectional analysis Marshall is pursuing through his posts is an excellent example of deriving the foresight needed to navigate this emerging future. The instance of nanotechnology shows us how one aspect of innovation accelerates, steers and amplifies another\u2019s effect. This trend is one of the driving forces behind the rapid development we are seeing.</p>\n<p>In 2017, and 2018, artificial intelligence was among the most hype-up. Many cool AI devices can change our lifestyle. These are:</p>\n<p>Virtual co-driver Chris is the very first remote driver assistant. It is a smart mobile app that can connect you while driving with your digital life. Mycroft is an adorable and smart home device which responds to verbal commands and communicates with other devices so you can quickly manage your home. Ambi climate application senses and gives users live data, which helps create a custom comfort profile, to change your environment optimally. Another example is Tapia, a household contact robot with a height of about 25 cm, is very compact. It is implemented with a camera, speaker, microphone, touch screen display, built-in battery, and so on. Besides speech recognition, voice synthesis, and face reorganization, you will enjoy communication with Tapia every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Mastery of AI:</strong> Artificial Intelligence ( AI) helps us reduce the error and the probability of achieving accuracy with greater precision. Artificial intelligence can be used in mining and other processes of fuel discovery. Artificial intelligence is commonly used for data processing and management by financial institutions and financial companies as well as banking institutions. The artificial intelligence can carry out repetitive jobs which are monotonous in nature. Artificial surgery finds a huge application to diagnose and control neurological conditions as it can mimic the activity of the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read About:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/what-makes-niet-the-no-1-engineering-college-in-delhi-ncr/\">Top Placement B.Tech Colleges in Delhi</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">Best Engineering College in Greater Noida</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/b-tech-in-cse\">b tech computer science colleges</a></p>\n\t</div>",

Many others further want to continue learning and go for Choosing a college is a big decision. There are many aspects of the college to consider and how they relate to your personal preferences. And, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in certain aspects of a college \u2014 like the really fancy dorms or the fact that your best friend goes there \u2013 and loses sight of the big picture (Is this the right place for you to learn skills for your career?). Believe it or not, there are many other factors that you should consider when choosing a college!</p>\r\n<h4>1. Placements</h4>\r\n<p>Knowing the cold, hard facts about how many graduates in a particular field find a job, and how quickly, will help you evaluate a potential college. Many colleges publish data about the percentage of students receiving a job offer within six months of graduation. Some colleges will offer more assistance to graduates seeking employment than others. Finding out the job placement rate will help you make sure that your tuition fees will be well spent and can influence your decision regarding the institution you choose to attend, as well as your area of study.</p>\r\n<p>The placement record of Noida Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology, Greater Noida, has been outstanding. It has been acknowledged many times in the past for providing Best Placement in the region consecutively for four years. Some of the companies visiting for campus are TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, ICICI Bank, HCL, Aditya Birla Group, Headstrong, IBM, Union Bank of India, Sahara Computers (South Africa), Blackberry, Indian Army, Evolution Consulting Ltd. (Canada), Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, etc. offering a <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">highest package of INR 30 lpa for 2014 batch.</b></p>\r\n<h4>2. Finishing School</h4>\r\n<p>College can open your eyes to careers you never knew existed, and the finishing school can be instrumental in preparing you for your professional life after graduation. This includes interview preparation, counselling, resume reviews, job placement support, and much more. A graduate needs not only excel in academics, but need a 360 degree improvement, in the areas like soft skills, life skills, technical skills and etiquettes. The Institute should also be exposing the students to time management, team-work and project management.</p>\r\n<p>In order to address this, NIET boasts of a <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">\u2018Pyramid Finishing School\u2019</b> to increase employability skills amongst fresh graduates, imparting world-class business skills for sustained performance and career success and to meet the ever-growing industry demand for suitable talent at the entry level. The students from all walks of life have gained tremendous confidence and have polished their personalities to be readily employable. This has resulted in NIET achieving the <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">award for Visionary Minds \u2013 2015 &amp; 2016 </b> and <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Most Employable students \u2013 2014 &amp; 2015</b> in the region.</p>\r\n<h4>3. Industry Tie-ups</h4>\r\n<p>There is a huge gap existing between industry and academia. To ensure that students passing out of the college are ready professionals, it is very important to bridge this gap through industry tie-ups. Colleges having these tie-ups help the students in being regular touch with the companies, have their manager visit the campus frequently, interact with the students and impart their own curriculum if needed, while students are undergoing training.</p>\r\n<p>NIET has made tie-ups with MNCs like <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Amazon, PTC, KPMG, ICICI Direct</b>, etc. These tie-ups not only promises to enhance student employability by manifold, but also takes the lead in encouraging \u2018innovative\u2019 learning like never before.</p>\r\n<h4>4. Entrepreneurship Development Cell</h4>\r\n<p>It takes more than just early stage risk-capital to get a company off the ground. Entrepreneurship has an unmatched ability to bring about disruptive change in society and engage with ventures across technology. The Entrepreneurship Cell should help budding entrepreneurs turn ideas into viable businesses.</p>\r\n<p>NIET has set up a <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Technology Business Incubator </b>which is approved by <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">DC-MSME</b>, <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India</b> to provide financial assistance to innovators and entrepreneurs for bringing innovations and ideas to life which will create economic opportunity and jobs for the country. In partnership with the mentors, corporates, development agencies, community and investors, the Institute cultivates a rare breed of entrepreneurs by incubating, accelerating, mentoring and funding innovative start-ups. It ensures a conducive ecosystem critical to promoting entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n<h4>5. Support for Higher Education</h4>\r\n<p>Access to higher education has become increasingly essential to obtain economic independence and success in today\u2019s world.\u00a0Students opting for further studies need outreach, professional development, advocacy, and networking opportunities for the right career path.</p>\r\n<p>NIET conceptualizes academic support to include academic advising; student academic transitions; academic preparedness; and developmental education among other forms of support. The Institute also trains students for <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">the GATE / GRE/ GMAT</b>, etc. We have devised the most effective modules which have been responsible for the outstanding results that our students have produced on these tests. NIET also has in-house Test centres like <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Prometric &amp; Pearson</b> which further enables students to give these exams within campus and at discounted prices.</p>\r\n<p>While deciding where to apply is often a stressful experience, knowing what things to consider when choosing a college can give you the confidence to apply wisely and end up at the institute that best meets your needs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Also Read About:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">Top 10 private B.Tech colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/b-tech-in-cse\">Top Computer Engineering colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">Top engineering colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n</div>",

    "short_description": "<p>NIET Blog 2 highlights on the Importance of Employability Skills. Unemployment the hottest topic under discussion after our honourable Prime Minister gave that statement about Pakora Selling.</p>",
    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>\u201cUnemployment\u201d became the hottest topic of discussion after our honourable Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi gave the statement about Pakora Selling. \u201cMore than 60% of the eight lakhs engineers graduating from technical institutions across the country every year remain unemployed, according to All India Council for Technical Education\u201d, says a report published in \u201cThe Times of India\u201d on March 18, 2017. The most popular explanation given for this is the lack of jobs. But, are there really only few jobs, or is it something else which is breeding this problem?</p>\r\n<p>95% of engineering graduates lack basic coding skills, 67% of engineering graduates are not fluent in English and nearly 61% of them possess grammar skills no better than an eighth standard student as stated in a recent survey by Aspiring Minds. According to experts of industry and academia, only 3.84% of fresh engineering graduates are employable.</p>\r\n<h4>WHAT IS EMPLOYABILITY?</h4>\r\n<p>\u201cThe skills and abilities that allow you to be employed\u201d, this is the basic definition of employability as per the Cambridge Business English Dictionary. Prof. Mantz Yorke defines employability as a set of achievements-skills, understandings and personal attributes-that make graduates more likely to gain employment and be successful in their chosen occupation, which benefits themselves, the workforce, the community and the economy. Employability is not about simply getting a job, it is an ongoing success in your career for now and in future. It is not a list of skills that can be taught, it draws on a wide range of skills abilities and attributes and can vary from individual to individual.</p>\r\n<p>To be geared up with employability skills is more important now than ever before in the light of world graduates are entering.</p>\r\n<h4>IMPORTANCE OF EMPLOYABILITY</h4>\r\n<p>Nowadays graduates cannot rely on their degree to get themselves assured a satiating future career as recruiters are looking for work-ready candidates equipped with profound skills to meet the demand of market and industry. So to keep themselves a step ahead in this competitive job market, employability skills must be developed by the students in their graduation time.</p>\r\n<p>Employers complain that neither graduates have adequate knowledge in their areas of study, nor conversant with current technology and advancement in their fields. Lack of innovation, communication skills, notably inability to express themselves clearly orally and in writing, as well as poor command in English language is mainly found these days within the candidates. These factors further lead to lack of confidence at work leading to delivery of poor service by graduates. The significant causes behind lack of employability skills in graduates are inappropriate curriculum, outdated syllabi, inadequate facilities &amp; infrastructure. At the technical institution level, it is noted that academic incompetency and poor background incapability based training of students is a critical factor impeding technical graduates from realising employable skills at technical institutions. Moreover, candidates in technical education institutions have been brought up in knowledge based system and ideally trained to pass exams rather than building competencies. While academics equip an individual for future career, they focus a little on honing and refinement of personality aspects essential for effective functioning in an organisation. Simultaneously, students are also required to be familiar with rules of etiquette and protocol critical to success in corporate setting.</p>\r\n<p>To bridge this gap, Noida Institute Of Engineering &amp; Technology, Greater Noida has come up with Pyramid Finishing School (PFS) where students are first assessed on their various skills. For these assessments, NIET sponsors various assessment programs, in association with Aspiring Minds (Amcat), Cocubes.com, Mettl and many others. After these assessments, particular training is being organised accordingly by PFS on soft skills, technical skills, aptitude, verbal/non-verbal communication, corporate/social etiquettes which results in industry-ready professionals. Some other prominent features of PFS are; Pearson Test Centre (PTC), certification from ICICI Direct, CISCO Network Academy, Cambridge English Language assessment, Microsoft Innovation Centre and tie-up with CDAC Pune.</p>\r\n<p>Inadequate supply of teaching and learning resources in technical institutes is yet another impediment to internalizing job skills by technical education candidates, the institutes are further confronted with the lack of competent instructors in the area of competency based training and required infrastructure, but NIET doesn\u2019t let its students feel the lack of any learning resources or infrastructures. At NIET, we have various innovation labs under expert supervision; Smart Manufacturing Lab (under PTC Centre of Excellence), Mercedes Benz Academy for Diploma in Advanced Mechatronics, Applied Robotics Control Lab in association with APS, Industrial robotic establishment at European Centre for Mechatronics Germany and a virtual lab at NIET Campus with expert supervision from European Centre, Cloud computing research and training lab in association with Microsoft Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services, Internet of Things (IoT) using Raspberry Pi in association with IBM, Centre of Excellence for mobile application development on Android Platform, Big Data Systems Lab in association with DELL EMC, Advanced Lab for Product Design and 3D printing in association with PTC, Centre of Excellence for Embedded &amp; VLSI Technology, Centre for Clinical Research and Bio-informatics and Centre for Process and Design Control.</p>\r\n<p>Another factor is inadequate industrial attachment for both technical education instructors and trainees that denies them hands-on-experience. To overcome this issue NIET organises various industrial talks by Genpact, Amazon, ICICI, Indian Army and many more. It also organises industrials visits to Gulf Islamic Investments (Dubai), Yakult, SOFCON, NEWATER (Singapore) and more.</p>\r\n<p>Also NIET hires instructors who have industrial experience; recently NIET has done a tie-up with Pega Systems. Under this program, 100 students will be trained to work on Pega Platform directly by Pega Systems itself.</p>\r\n<p>\u201cTo be employed is to be at risk, to be employable is to be secure\u201d \u2013Peter Hawkins</p>\r\n<p>So next time when you think of getting employed, first think about having employability skills.</p>\r\n<h2>Also Read About:</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/b-tech-in-cse\">Best Colleges for Computer Engineering </a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">Top Private B.Tech Colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/2022/04/22/what-makes-niet-the-best-placement-college-in-delhi-ncr/\">Best Placement College in Delhi NCR UP</a></p>\r\n</div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t<p>Students who have enrolled for Science Streams in their Higher Secondary Classes (Std XI and XII) most often opt for Engineering Colleges as their next step in their academic career. This is an important decision as a lot depends on the institution from where you obtain your degree.</p>\n<p>A well-known engineering college adds value to your degree and, subsequently, your resume. However, you need to find a\u00a0top private engineering college in India\u00a0that has a specialization that suits your aptitude and interests. Therefore, do not settle for an engineering college simply because your friends are going there or since it is an established brand.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the college fee must fit your family budget. You need to be confident that the program and the institution will be worth your time and resources. In this blog, we will analyze the factors that you should keep in mind before zeroing in on an engineering college.</p>\n<p><strong>Importance of Top Engineering Colleges for a Prosperous Career</strong></p>\n<p>Your choice of engineering college can make or break your career. An engineering degree comes after 4 years of devoted academic training, and so you do not want it to go waste. While it needs the student to work hard and be dedicated to the program, they need good guidance from the faculty members too. Some of India\u2019s top engineering colleges have made a mark for their highly qualified and experienced professors. Some of these\u00a0top engineering colleges are in Delhi and UP.</p>\n<p><strong>The reasons for getting into the best engineering college in the country are as follows:</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"display: table;\">\n<li><strong>Growth:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>An Engineering degree is meant to ensure that you can achieve steady growth in your academic and professional lives. It is a great program to help you bag a well-paying job and build a reputation in society. However, these goals cannot be fulfilled unless you secure good grades. The reputation of your college in the industry also adds to the value of your degree.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dream Job:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The journey of every engineering graduate would have started someday with the dream of becoming an engineer. There are many streams in which one can attain an engineering degree \u2014 Mechanical, Civil, Computer Science, or Biotechnology \u2014 but your dreams are specific, and hence the pursuit should also be in that direction. And this is why your college plays an integral part in your securing the dream job.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href=\"https://niet.co.in/blog/top-7-reasons-to-pursue-a-degree-in-biotechnology/\">Top 7 Reasons to Pursue a Degree in Biotechnology</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Steady Career:\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, you have got your dream job. Now what? How do you ensure that your career remains steady? This is where your college matters. A good teaching and assessment program ensure that you are well-equipped to tackle the practical challenges of your job. In-depth knowledge of your stream of study and an ability to provide appropriate suggestions and solutions to the problems arising in your field of work will help you get noticed and ensure that you stand a good chance of getting timely appraisals and promotions. And you need a good institution to make you ready for all of this.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> \u00a0<a href=\"https://niet.co.in/blog/mechanical-engineering-a-good-career-choice-undoubtedly/\">Mechanical Engineering: A Good Career Choice, Undoubtedly!</a></p>\n<p><strong>How to Choose Top Private Engineering Colleges in India?</strong></p>\n<p>While we are proud to have a vast number of\u00a0private colleges in Delhi for BTech, we should not forget that this only means we have that many engineering graduates vying for a respectable job in a reputed company. This makes the competition tough and sometimes brutal. One of the ways to stay ahead in this race is by securing a slot in one of the top engineering colleges, as the brand name of the institution is bound to get you noticed and give you an upper hand in the placement rounds.</p>\n<p>Let us look at some of the points to consider while zeroing in on an Engineering college. This will help you a lot in understanding\u00a0how to choose a good engineering college in India.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose a Specialization/Branch:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is what you need to know first \u2014 the specialization in which you want to secure an engineering degree. It could be automobiles, aviation, chemical, civil or biochemical, but you need to make up your mind on the stream of your choice. Once you know this, you can correspondingly start sorting the colleges. There are a good enough number of engineering colleges for each of these streams so you can start your search by looking at the\u00a0top 10 engineering colleges in India.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accreditation &amp; Affiliation:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is an important aspect and is as relevant as the brand name of the institution. Engineering colleges in India are accredited by NAAC, NBA, or AICTE. This ensures that the curriculum and teaching methods adopted by an engineering college meet national standards. A new engineering college may not have these affiliations, and hence it is a risk to enroll in such an institution. However, a college established by a well-known institution can still hold relevance in the market.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Industry-Synced Curriculum:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A degree from a reputed college can help you get your dream job if you can clear the placement rounds or other hiring tests. However, this is a fairly difficult task if your understanding of the industry trends and relevant topics is not up to the mark. Hence, you need to understand well if the curriculum that your chosen college meets industry standards and norms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Faculty Members:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A college with a big brand and great infrastructure may not be the best option for an engineering student if the faculty members do not have the requisite expertise to teach the programs covered. Some engineering colleges rope in professionals as faculty members since they will be able to share their industry experiences with the students. This can be a good experience for engineering students. Some colleges have visiting faculty industry experts interact with students during guest lectures and seminars. This is often an integral part of engineering programs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Labs &amp; Infrastructure:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most engineering specializations require students to have access to computer labs and equipment. It is therefore imperative that colleges provide their students with all the necessary infrastructure. You must check the background of a college in this aspect. It doesn\u2019t help if an institute has a great faculty but little or no infrastructure to support the teaching modules.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Campus Placements:\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>An engineering college without a good placement cell makes no sense. Colleges that have earned a reputation in the engineering arena have predominantly done so because of their good record in placements. Engineering graduates are one of the most sought-after candidates in sectors like IT, Automobile, Automation, Biotechnology, and Aeronautics. Therefore, it is a necessity that these colleges can provide strong placement assistance and guidance to students.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location and Demography:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engineering colleges have traditionally found a strong foothold in cities that are traditional bastions of tech majors and IT giants. For instance, Bengaluru and Hyderabad have a strong presence of these companies and have now turned into a hub of engineering colleges. Most of these graduates also get absorbed by the companies stationed there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diverse Campus:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The life of engineering students has been turned into novels and movies. This is proof enough to tell you that the campuses play a key role in shaping up the personality and career graph of engineering students. So, do not ignore the need to have a campus that represents the diversity of the real world. It keeps you grounded and provides you with valuable life lessons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Value for Money:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engineering degrees don\u2019t come cheap. Some established colleges have a steep fee, but it comes with the assurance that the brand is big enough to provide the student with a comfortable and successful career. Hence, if you are going to spend your life savings on getting your child a seat in any of the top engineering colleges, do make sure that it is a college that will give you value for money, in other words, a secure future for your ward.</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://niet.co.in/blog/top-12-reasons-to-join-niet-institute-for-successful-career-path/\">Top 12 Reasons to Join NIET Institute for Successful Career Path</a></p>\n<p><strong>NIET, Greater Noida \u2013 The Top Private Engineering College in UP</strong></p>\n<p>Any discussion about engineering colleges is incomplete without NIET, the first private institutes in Uttar Pradesh to have got the UGC autonomous status.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>Artificial Intelligence is a new age technology that has the potential to change our lives and is<br>already in use. It is simply, as the name suggests, intelligence that is acquired and put to use<br>artificially. Humans are naturally intelligent, but when we make machines or software that can<br>acquire knowledge, can learn, and can predict intelligent behavior while problem-solving, those<br>machines are said to have artificial intelligence capabilities.</p>\r\n<p>It is a rapidly evolving technology and there\u2019s a huge demand for it in the IT industry. AI has many<br>sub-branches that are widely used in the industry. Natural Language Processing, Image<br>Processing, Text Processing, <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-machine-learning/\">Machine Learning</a>, etc. are some of the widely used subtechnologies of AI.</p>\r\n<p>We all use Siri/Google Assistant/Alexa, well all these voice assistants make use of AI, machine<br>learning, and natural language processing, to understand our instructions and give a suitable and<br>intelligent answer every time. Self-Driving cars use machine learning and AI to find obstacles<br>and/or people on the road and to identify lanes. There are various such examples that make use<br>of AI. This tells us how much AI affects our lives and how much it is capable of shaping our future.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, many colleges and institutes have started providing B. Tech courses in Artificial<br>Intelligence Specialization. However, choosing just any college for studying AI isn\u2019t an intelligent<br>thing to do. AI sounds simple in concept but it isn\u2019t that simple in learning an implementation. So,<br>if you wish to study AI and have a future in it, it is fairly crucial to choose/select a college that<br>provides quality education and good placement opportunities for all its students.</p>\r\n<p>Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, Greater Noida, is one such college that focuses<br>on academics and has an excellent placement record. The institute recently became autonomous<br>and got the opportunity to add modern and industry-level courses to its curriculum. Many new and<br>in-demand courses like B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering \u2013 Data Science, B.Tech.</p>\r\n<p>in Computer Science and Engineering \u2013 Internet of Things, B.Tech. in Computer Science and<br>Engineering \u2013 Artificial Intelligence, B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering \u2013 Artificial<br>Intelligence and Machine Learning, and B.Tech. in Computer Science and Business System, are<br>offered by the institute, with industry tie-ups, practical learning, hands-on experience, and bestin-class placements with guaranteed placement assistance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>NIET is the only private institute in UP to be recognized by all three government organizations</strong><br>i.e.-<br>1. <strong>NAAC \u2018A\u2019</strong> (3.23 | A grade highest in Uttar Pradesh)<br>2. <strong>NBA</strong> for CSE, IT, ECE, ME, BT, BPharm, MBA &amp; MCA<br>3. <strong>NIRF 2021 Rank Band</strong> Top 200 (171st position) in Engineering and 43rd<br>Rank in Pharmacy<br>4. <strong>NIRF 2020 Rank Band 201-250:</strong> Engineering</p>\r\n<p>All our professors are well qualified and give equal importance to practical as well as theoretical<br>learning. NIET has a learning environment, and everyone is supportive in the various endeavors<br>of students \u2013 be it research or start-ups!</p>\r\n<p>NIET has been ranked by various ranking bodies over the years as UP\u2019s No. 1 and Greater<br>Noida\u2019s No. 1 private institution, due to its excellence in teaching and excellent and consistent<br>placement records.</p>\r\n<p>Going autonomous has helped the institute in being at par with the latest and in-demand courses<br>and providing a modern and revised curriculum. State universities can often have old and/or<br>outdated curriculum, but being autonomous gives an institute the liberty to inculcate modern<br>courses and curriculum into its academia and provide what\u2019s best for its students.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/admissions/faqs\"><strong>Enquiry for Admission 2024</strong></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Also Read About:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">Top private B.Tech colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/what-makes-niet-the-no-1-engineering-college-in-delhi-ncr/\">Top placement B.Tech colleges in Delhi</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/btech-cs\">b tech computer science colleges</a></p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n</div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>Gone are the days when Engineering and Medical were considered noble degrees and available only for a few. According to a survey, in 2019, 8,80,000 students took admission in engineering in the CSE branch alone. This gives us a hint that total engineering students would\u2019ve been around 15,00,000 at least. Now with this much competition, it is very difficult for the students to land a good job. Moreover, most engineering colleges are not up to the mark to provide proper engineering education.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, post-graduation is becoming highly popular these days. People complete their 4-year engineering course (BE/BTech) and go for a higher degree depending on their field of interest. It is seen that quite a lot of students consider management after engineering, in search of higher pay and managerial positions in the corporate world. On the contrary, many students also opt for M. Tech i.e. postgrad in engineering, which can be both, for research purposes or for corporate jobs involving a better understanding of specific engineering disciplines.</p>\r\n<p>Although engineering alone is a professional degree and all the students who have done engineering are eligible to work in the industry without any further training or education whatsoever, yet a postgrad degree is definitely more beneficial than a grad degree. The main hindrance in an M. Tech/ME is time. B. Tech/BE alone takes 4 years, after those 2 years for M. Tech/ME, this takes away 6 valuable years, which is no problem for students pursuing research, but for those who study just to get a good job in the industry, 6 years can be a long studying time.</p>\r\n<p>This problem of time is solved by something that we call an integrated degree, i.e. B. Tech+ M. Tech. As is evident by the name, this integrated degree is now offered at most of the prestigious institutes and is of 5-year duration. An integrated degree comes into play especially in the<br>companies that demand experience along with BTech. M. Tech degree holders usually do not require experience to get jobs. Thus, an integrated course is the best if you want to get a better job as soon as possible, the main plus point of this degree is not having to waste 6 years. Additionally, an integrated course has a lesser fee when compared to separately doing graduation and post-graduation.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most important aspects of an integrated BTech + MTech course is selecting a good college. After all, a good college means better education and better knowledge.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>\u201cThe IoT is big news because it ups the ante: \u2018Reach out and touch somebody\u2019 is becoming \u2018reach out and touch everything\u2019.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Parker Trewin</p>\r\n<h3>Why is IoT so Important?</h3>\r\n<p>In recent years, IoT has been one of the 21st century\u2019s most influential innovations. We can link everyday objects such as cars, cooking appliances, thermostats, baby monitors, etc. to the internet through embedded devices. Seamless communication is possible between people, systems, and items. Physical things can share and gather data with minimal human intervention by low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies. In this irreducible world, digital systems can record, track, and modify any interaction between the items related.</p>\r\n<h3>What Technologies Have Made IoT Possible?</h3>\r\n<p>While the principle of IoT has been in existence for a long time, it has become a reality through a series of recent developments in many different technologies.</p>\r\n<h4>1. Low-cost</h4>\r\n<p>low-power sensor technology available. Inexpensive and reliable sensors allow manufacturers to use IoT technology.</p>\r\n<h4>2. Signing in</h4>\r\n<p>A host of internet network protocols have made connecting sensors to the cloud simple for efficient data transmission.</p>\r\n<h4>3. Systems for Cloud computing</h4>\r\n<p>The growth in cloud platform availability allows both companies and customers to access the resources they need to scale up without needing to manage it directly.</p>\r\n<h4>4. Analytics and machine learning</h4>\r\n<p>Businesses can gain information faster and easier with advancements in machine learning and analytics, along with access to diverse and large volumes of data stored in the cloud. Publication of these allied technologies continues to expand IoT\u2019s limits, and IoT\u2019s generated data also feeds these technologies.</p>\r\n<h4>5. AI (Artificial Intelligence)</h4>\r\n<p>Advances in neural networks have introduced natural-language processing (NLP) to IoT devices (such as Alexa, Cortana and Siri digital personal assistants) and made them appealing, affordable and feasible for home-usage.</p>\r\n<h4>How is IoT for Industry?</h4>\r\n<p>Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to the implementation of IoT technology in industrial environments, in particular concerning instrumentation and monitoring of sensors and devices participating in cloud technologies. IIoT is also called Industrial Revolution Fourth Wave, or Industry 4.0. Some specific uses of IIoT are as follows:<br>Smart manufacturing<br>Preventive and predictive maintenance<br>Smart power grids<br>Smart cities<br>Connected and smart logistics<br>Smart digital supply chains</p>\r\n<!--<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-149\" src=\"http://niet.co.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/internet.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"190\"></p>-->\r\n<h3>What are the Top IoT Applications?</h3>\r\n<p>IoT\u2019s ability to provide sensor information and allow device-to-device communication is driving an extensive array of applications. The following are some of the most popular features and what they are doing.</p>\r\n<p>Establish new manufacturing efficiencies by control of the equipment and the product quality. Machines can be tracked and tested continuously to ensure that they work within the appropriate tolerances.<br>Enhance monitoring of physical properties and \u201cring-fencing.\u201d Tracking helps businesses to identify the position of the stuff quickly. Ring-fencing allows them to ensure high-value assets are secured from theft and removal.<br>Use wearables to track environmental and human health analytics. IoT wearables enable people to understand their health better and allow doctors to monitor patients remotely.</p>\r\n<p>Drive efficiencies in current processes and new possibilities; One example of this is the use of IoT to make fleet management effective and safer. Companies can use IoT fleet monitoring to guide trucks to boost performance in real-time.</p>\r\n<p>Allow changes to business processes. One example is the use of IoT devices to track remote machinery\u2019s health and cause service calls for preventive maintenance.</p>\r\n<h3>What Can Industries Benefit from IoT?</h3>\r\n<p>Organizations best suited for IoT are those that would benefit from using sensor devices:</p>\r\n<h4>Manufacturing</h4>\r\n<p>Manufacturers can gain a competitive advantage when sensors detect an imminent malfunction by using production line monitoring to allow take-over maintenance on equipment. Manufacturers may quickly test equipment for quality, or withdraw it from output until it is fixed, with the aid of sensor warnings.</p>\r\n<h4>Automotive</h4>\r\n<p>Industry stands to realize significant benefits from the use of IoT software. The benefits of applying IoT to production lines, sensors can also detect nearing equipment failure in vehicles already on the road and can alert the driver with details and advice. IoT-based apps, designers and manufacturers will be able to learn more about how to keep vehicles going and car owners updated.</p>\r\n<h4>Transport and Logistics</h4>\r\n<p>Transport and logistics services are benefiting from IoT applications. Thanks to IoT sensor info, motor vehicles such as cars, buses, ships and trains carrying inventory can be re-routed according to weather conditions, driver availability, and vehicle availability. The product itself may also have sensors for track-and-trace and temperature-control.</p>\r\n<h4>Retail</h4>\r\n<p>IoT applications allow retail companies to control inventory, enhance customer service, optimize the supply chain and reduce operating costs. Smart shelves with weight sensors, for example, can collect information based on radio frequency detection and send the data to the IoT network for warnings and automatically monitor when the inventory of items are running low.</p>\r\n<h4>Public sector</h4>\r\n<p>The advantages of IoT are equally considerate in the public sector and other service-related environments. For instance, government-owned utilities may use IoT-based applications to alert their users of mass outages and even smaller water, electricity, or sewer service interruptions. IoT systems may gather data about the severity of an outage and deploy resources to help utilities recover more quickly from outages.</p>\r\n<h4>Monitoring of healthcare</h4>\r\n<p>IoT assets provides many benefits for the healthcare sector. Doctors, nurses, and an attendant also need to know precisely where patient-assistance devices like wheelchairs are stored. When the wheelchairs of a hospital are fitted with IoT sensors, they can be monitored from the IoT asset tracking program, so that the nearest accessible wheelchair can be identified easily by anyone searching for one.</p>\r\n<h4>General safety in all sectors</h4>\r\n<p>In addition to tracking physical property, IoT can be used to enhance safety in the workplace; for example, employees in dangerous environments such as oil and gas fields, mines, and chemical and power plants need to know about the likelihood of a dangerous accident that could impact them. They can be informed of incidents or saved from them when they are linked to IoT sensor based applications. IoT implementations also refer to wearables that can monitor human health and environmental conditions. These kinds of apps not only help people better understand their health, but also allow doctors to monitor patients remotely.</p>\r\n<h4>Why does IoT change the world?</h4>\r\n<p>IoT reinvents the car through the development of connected vehicles. Vehicle owners may use IoT to operate their cars remotely \u2014 like preheating the car before the driver gets into it, or calling for a vehicle remotely by phone. With IoT\u2019s ability to allow device-to-device communication, cars will also be able to book their service appointments where necessary. The connected automobile allows manufacturers or dealers to transform the idea of car ownership on its heads. Earlier, producers had an arms-length relationship with individual clients (or none at all). Car manufacturers or dealers may use connected vehicles to maintain a continuous relationship with their customers. Instead of selling vehicles, they can charge drivers user fees, providing a \u201ctransportation-as-a-service\u201d through autonomous cars. IoT lets manufacturers constantly upgrade their cars with new technology, a break from the traditional model of car ownership in which vehicles depreciate both in performance and value at once.</p>\r\n<h3>Also Read About:</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/what-makes-niet-the-no-1-engineering-college-in-delhi-ncr/\">Best Engineering Colleges in Delhi</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/exploring-the-top-it-engineering-college-in-greater-noida/\">Top Computer Engineering colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n</div>",

All species communicate to each other. The languages are nothing but a medium to represent the thoughts but as technology evolves people can talk to machine also.\u00a0For example Siri or Alexa, Facebook friend suggestions, Gmail spam filters, traffic congestion predictions are some common examples where one talks to a machine and all this is machine learning.</p>\r\n<p>Machine Learning (ML) is emerging as one of the hottest fields today.\u201c<b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allows computer programs to automatically improve through experience</b>\u201d as defined by Computer Scientist and machine learning expert\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tom M. Mitchell</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The scientific field of\u00a0<b style=\"display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"https://mld.ai/mldcmu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">machine learning</a></b>\u00a0(ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed by relying on patterns and inference instead.</p>\r\n<h3>How does machine learning work?</h3>\r\n<p>Machine learning utilizes a variety of techniques to intelligently handle large and complex amounts of information to make decisions and/or predictions. It describes computer algorithms trained with real-world data to build predictive models.\u00a0 An algorithm can be thought of as a set of rules/instructions that a computer programmer specifies which a computer is able to process. Machine learning algorithms are learnt by experience, similar to as humans do. For example, after having seen multiple examples of an object, a compute-employing machine learning algorithm can become able to recognize that object in new, previously unseen scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>In practice, the patterns that a computer (machine learning system) learns can be very complicated and difficult to explain. Once the machine learning model has been trained, we can give different images as input to see if it can correctly differentiate between them.</p>\r\n<h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>\r\n<p>There are different types of machine learning for different kinds of problems. There are generally two categories: supervised and unsupervised \u2013 but sometimes combination of both is also used.</p>\r\n<h3>Supervised Machine Learning</h3>\r\n<p>In Supervised Machine Learning our training data contains known, correct answers for the thing we\u2019re trying to predict. It\u2019s called\u00a0<em>supervised</em>\u00a0because we can easily evaluate how good our model is while it is being trained by comparing it to known correct answers. Most machine learning algorithms fall into the supervised learning category including regression, decision trees, XGBoost, and many more.</p>\r\n<p>In the field of machine learning, the thing we try to predict is the\u00a0<em>label</em>. So, supervised machine learning deals with\u00a0<em>labeled</em>\u00a0training data.</p>\r\n<h3>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h3>\r\n<p>Sometimes, we try to find hidden patterns in the data we have. The goal in unsupervised learning is generally to cluster the data into characteristically different groups. Unsupervised machine learning is more challenging than supervised learning due to the absence of labels. The unknown attributes are called\u00a0<em>latent features</em>. Techniques such as K-means clustering, principal component analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, and K-nearest-neighbors can be used to uncover these latent features.</p>\r\n<p>Here as we don\u2019t know the correct answers, unsupervised algorithms use\u00a0<em>unlabeled</em>\u00a0training data.</p>\r\n<h3>Semi-Supervised Learning</h3>\r\n<p>Real-world projects aren\u2019t always so definite.</p>\r\n<p>In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained upon a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. Typically, this combination will contain a very small amount of labeled data and a very large amount of unlabeled data. The basic procedure involved is that first, the programmer will cluster similar data using an unsupervised learning algorithm and then use the existing labeled data to label the rest of the unlabeled data.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0Supervised learning is used to train a model that assigns labels to unlabeled data, based on the human-generated labels it receives. With some practice we can compare the labels produced by the supervised algorithm to the labels produced by humans. As they start to agree, we can use the supervised model to label our training data instead of humans in cases where the model has high confidence. Those machine-generated labels are called\u00a0<em>pseudo-labels</em>. Since our training data now contains a mixture of known labels assigned by humans and data that was inferred by a model, these models are called\u00a0<em>semi-supervised</em>.</p>\r\n<h3>Areas where ML is employed</h3>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Machine learning technology has immense advantages in the industries which are working with large amounts of data. It has been observed that the organizations working with ML are able to work more efficient and be ahead their competitors.</p>\r\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.sas.com/en_in/industry/banking.html\">Financial services</a></b></p>\r\n<p>The two key purposes to use machine learning technology in banks and other businesses in the financial industry are to identify important insights in data, and prevent fraud.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>In songs, poems and novels the term \u2018cloud\u2019 has been used since time immemorial. Who can forget the famous lines of William Wordsworth, \u201c<i>I wandered lonely as a cloud\u2026\u201d </i>Despite this gap between imagery and actuality, \u201cthe cloud\u201d has succeeded in becoming the agreed-upon shorthand for modern data storage.\u00a0As far as it relates to computers,\u00a0<a href=\"http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/original-thinking/why-is-it-called-quotcloud-computingquot-30713\">the term \u201ccloud\u201d dates back to early network design</a>, when engineers would map out all the various components of their networks. The term \u2018Cloud computing\u2019 has been there since the early 2000s, but the concept of computing-as-a-service is much older than we might think. It goes back to 1960s when computer bureaus were built to rent time on a mainframe for companies instead of buying one.</p>\r\n<p>By the emergence of the PC in 1980s, these \u2018time-sharing\u2019 services were completely replaced, as it had become cheaper to own one\u2019s own computer to store and access data.</p>\r\n<p>But in due course of time when a large data has been collected over internet the concept of renting access to computing power has come in to play repeatedly \u2014 like utility computing, and grid computing of the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>\r\n<p>This was followed by cloud computing, which really took hold with the emergence of software as a service and large scale cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle and many others.</p>\r\n<p>Cloud computing is a method of storing and accessing data and programs from any device that can access the internet. It has reduced the requirement of a computer\u2019s hard drive.</p>\r\n<p>The data in the cloud is stored on several physical and/or virtual servers that are provided by a third-party service provider.</p>\r\n<h3>Types of cloud services</h3>\r\n<p>There are three basic types of cloud services:</p>\r\n<h4>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>\r\n<p>It is the most commonly acknowledged cloud service software. This includes a variety of services, such as file storage and backup, web-based email and project management tools.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of SaaS cloud service providers include Dropbox, G Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Slack and Citrix Content Collaboration. In these applications, users can access, share, store and secure information in \u201cthe cloud.\u201d</p>\r\n<h4>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h4>\r\n<p>Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS is a cloud-computing offering in which a vendor provides users access to computing resources such as servers, storage\u00a0and networking. It serves as the complete data center framework, eliminating the need for resource-intensive and on-site installations.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of IaaS are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Compute Engine. In these providers all storage servers and networking hardwares are maintained. Providers manage security, operating systems, server software\u00a0and backups.</p>\r\n<h4>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4>\r\n<p>Platform as a service, or PaaS, serves is a web-based service where developers can create cloud apps. PaaS enables its users to access a database, operating system and programming language that can be used to develop cloud-based software.Many IaaS vendor also offer PaaS capabilities.</p>\r\n<h4>Cloud computing for Engineers</h4>\r\n<p>Cloud computing is one of the hottest technologies with a high demand for qualified professionals. Since it is a specialty area it is not an easy thing for an individual to acquire a job in this field.</p>\r\n<p>Some skills required for obtaining a secured position in cloud computing are:</p>\r\n<h4>Programming Languages and Coding Skills</h4>\r\n<p>Java and C languages are two of the most common languages, but these are rarely used in creating cloud computing services The data-oriented programming languages like SQL, XML data language, and R Math Language, in addition to Python and Ruby are needed in addition to exceptional coding skills.</p>\r\n<h4>Linux</h4>\r\n<p>This is another skill required for cloud computing job. At present bout a fourth of the servers is powered by Linux based Microsoft Azure and it is definitely going to increase with the coming days.</p>\r\n<h4>Cloud Security</h4>\r\n<p>Security is an in important factor when cloud\u00a0storage is concerned. It is one of the primary aspect developers are looking into.To secure the data of their organizations, professionals can use various security tools in the market.CCSP\u00a0(Certified Cloud Security Professional) training provides an adequate and professional understanding of Cloud Security.</p>\r\n<h4>Artificial\u00a0Intelligence\u00a0(AI)</h4>\r\n<p>The technologies that can perform exemplary actions at data integration, aggregation, and analysis without human assistance like: Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are gaining more attention in the field of Cloud-based technology</p>\r\n<h4>Database Management\u00a0Skills</h4>\r\n<p>Collecting, storing, maintaining, and accessing data stored in the cloud is pivotal to cloud systems. Hence, data management\u00a0becomes a most significant skill. Along with this Data-oriented languages like SQL and Hadoop are a must.</p>\r\n<h4>Cloud Platforms</h4>\r\n<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are two of the leading cloud platforms including some others.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t<p>Men\u2019s dominance in the technological sector has been under dramatic change, partly due to institutions such as the Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology (NIET) that are championing women\u2019s empowerment in technology. NIET, one of the<a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/what-makes-niet-the-no-1-engineering-college-in-delhi-ncr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> top 10 Engineering institute in Delhi NCR</a>, is more than just a learning centre; it is an agent of transformation within gender equity in tech.</p>\n<h2><strong>Breaking Barriers: NIET\u2019s Approach</strong></h2>\n<p>NIET aims to build an atmosphere conducive to women\u2019s careers in IT. The curriculum begins with inclusivity and relevancy. NIET engages in real-world tech challenges and encourages hands-on learning in order for female students to participate in technology rather than be its viewers or audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentorship Programs: </strong>\u00a0A pivotal aspect of NIET\u2019s activities lies in its mentoring programs, which is one of the reasons why it is one of the top 5 B.Tech colleges in Delhi NCR. Such programs link female students with well-off women in the technology sector, offering them role models for their ventures. Exposure to successful women in tech positions helps break through that \u201cglass ceiling\u201d and motivates students to shoot for the stars.</p>\n<p><strong>Workshops and Seminars: </strong>NIET conducts regular workshops and seminars for sensitization and empowerment of women. Tech Leadership events are wide-ranging, including technical skills training, start-up business, as well as technology. Such efforts enable women to attain self-confidence and skills to succeed in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IT</a> sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurial Ventures: </strong>Many NIET graduates have tried their hand at entrepreneurship by setting up technological firms with unique success stories. However, these women go beyond being mere business leaders by showcasing the fact that women could lead and thrive in the technology entrepreneurship venture.</p>\n<p><strong>Leadership Roles in Tech Giants: </strong>NIET\u2019s alums have taken up leadership positions across different tech giants. They reached such a position due to the high-quality education and empowerment they got from NIET. They are rewriting the story and showing the world that a woman could be the CEO of a tech company.</p>\n<p><strong>Contributions to Cutting-Edge Tech: </strong>Some women from NIET are also at the forefront of emerging technology frontiers like AI, machine learning, and blockchain. While their work goes beyond what they have accomplished with technology, education from one of the top 10 Engineering institutes in Delhi NCR, serves as an example and encouragement for women who also want to venture into tech.</p>\n<h2><strong>NIET\u2019s Role in Changing Perceptions</strong></h2>\n<p>Being one of the top 10 Engineering institutes in Delhi NCR, NIET has been instrumental in redefining male-centered attitudes through continuous support for females in technology. Success stories of the institute act as a piece of persuasive evidence that other women, too, can work professionally in the IT sphere. This view change is important because it will help other women embrace these fields of occupation.</p>\n<p><strong>Collaboration with Industry:</strong> NIET partners with various tech firms and start-ups to offer its students on-the-job training and internship experiences. However, these partnerships are especially helpful to women who are usually able to make the best out of them since they offer a channel through which women display their abilities in an unfolded industrial process.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholarships and Financial Support:</strong> Aware that financial difficulties may pose challenges, NIET provides scholarships and financial support to worthwhile female students. This, in turn, does not allow talented women to be disadvantaged or limited when it comes to chasing their financial constraints on achieving their tech dreams.</p>\n<h3><strong>Summing Up</strong></h3>\n<p>NIET has emerged as one of the torchbearers that have been guiding a road towards reform for the IT sector, especially for the Delhi NCR region. However, this is more than merely training tech-wise ladies; this is how to create a well-balanced tech community. That\u2019s praiseworthy \u2013 since NIET is among the top 5 B. Tech colleges in Delhi NCR \u2013 others will follow suit.</p>\n<p>Empowering women in tech is a prolonged and cumbersome pursuit, yet there is an institution like <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIET</a> moving on with one great story after another. They are seeking ways to create a gender-free environment whereby girls can achieve success on a larger scale.</p>\n\t</div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>You must have been trying to know about MBA and PGDM. While planning for a management degree, you should know the difference between these two programs to make a wise decision.</p>\r\n<p>MBA stands for Masters of Business Administration, while PGDM for Post Graduate Diploma in Management. Offered by B schools, these programs are intended for a successful career in management. Here are some fundamental differences between these programs that an aspirant must be aware of:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Degree vs Diploma</strong></p>\r\n<p>A government-affiliated college or private university can offer an MBA program. These universities are the only ones that can grant degrees.</p>\r\n<p>AICTE-recognized business schools and autonomous institutes or colleges offer PGDM programs under the guidance of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD). UGC has less involvement with PGDM courses in comparison to MBA degrees.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Curriculum</strong></p>\r\n<p>MBA programs generally have a set curriculum. There is some rigidity in curriculum revisions to keep up with economic and industry changes. The PGDM curriculum can, however, be modified or updated at the B school\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fee Structure</strong></p>\r\n<p>MBA courses are conducted at colleges and universities, which receive grants and recognition from UGC or government subsidies. Fees are generally lower than PGDM programs because colleges and universities offer them. Undoubtedly, PGDM programs require a significant investment of capital. The result is evident in the expensive program fees borne by institutes and independent business schools running PGDM campus programs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Criteria for Entrance Exam:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Both programs accept scores from competitive exams such as the CAT, MAT and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Management_Admission_Test\">GMAT</a>. Many colleges and universities accept scores from state-based tests like the MAHCET or PGCET, TSICET, &amp; TANCET for MBA programs. Some top schools conduct their tests, for example \u2013 XAT (XLRI), Symbiosis (SNAP) and IIFT.</p>\r\n<p>PGDM schools mostly do not fix a definite cut-off for admission, but a suitable score threshold for shortlisting depends on other factors like professional achievements, relevant experience and academic performance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MBA &amp; PGDM at NIET, Greater Noida</strong></p>\r\n<p>MBA is a full-time two-year course divided into four semesters. AICTE, New Delhi, has approved the program and is affiliated with Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University in Lucknow. The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) has also accredited the course. The MBA program is committed to providing professional experience through education and industrial exposure.</p>\r\n<p>PGDM course at NIET is recognized by AICTE, New Delhi. The course duration is 2 years, divided into six semesters. Course curriculum is in accordance with the changing industrial demands. Students enrolled in the course learn the skills that make them grab good salary packages.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Educational Objectives of MBA at NIET</strong></p>\r\n<p>This two-year, full-time MBA program is designed to achieve the following educational objectives:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The management program graduates will be able to apply management principles in professional settings and have the conceptual knowledge to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.</li>\r\n<li>Graduates will use the appropriate tools to make decisions to solve complex managerial problems within a local or global context.</li>\r\n<li>The management program graduates will be able to demonstrate integrity, social responsibility and teamwork.</li>\r\n<li>Graduates will have a strong sense of ethics, leadership qualities, and a creative and innovative entrepreneurial mindset.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Educational Objectives of PGDM at NIET</strong></p>\r\n<p>PGDM course at NIET is designed to meet the below educational objectives:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>PGDM program is focused on helping the students get the best career path so that they become industry ready after the course completion.</li>\r\n<li>Program is designed by the professionals to deliver experiential knowledge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Apart from these, NIET, Greater Noida, has a successful record of placements over the years. It has been recognized as the <a title=\"best MBA college for placements in NCR\" href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/mba-programmes.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best MBA college for placements in NCR</a>.

There are many ways that you can actually gather complete information about a particular course that you are planning to take up. Online websites are completely helpful when it comes to the right kind of information related to the course. Students who are working in the same field will actually be a very good option.</p>\n<h3><strong>Do you have any information about the future prospect?</strong></h3>\n<p>When you decide to go for a particular course after completing class twelve, it is very vital to know about the future prospects related to it. Another very important factor that plays a role is the career opportunities that it comes with. If you find that the course you have chosen will give you hard times in getting a job, it is better to avoid it. Going for a course that has enough bundled opportunities in the market will always make it a huge success. Look for the prospects that are available for higher studies in the same field, which you can continue even after completion of the course. Without gaining complete information about the future prospects related to opportunities, do not go for the course after completion of your board examinations.</p>\n<h3><strong>Create a proper list</strong></h3>\n<p>You should make a complete list of all the things that you actually like to do and completely dislike. This actually means making a list of subjects that you would absolutely love to study and the subjects that you do not want to study in the future. This will actually help in concentrating on a good number of courses, and then you can always shortlist the best one among them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Look for the income</strong></h3>\n<p>The main motives behind education and taking up a career are always about the source of income that it generates. Therefore, when you decide to choose your career opportunity or option after completing class twelve, it is essential that you look for an income source. If you find that the course will not be very lucrative in terms of income, you might drop the opportunity. On the other hand, if you still love the course and do not pay much attention to the income, you are good to go. If you want to work for self-satisfaction and experience, the doors towards various career opportunities are open for you. It is recommended to pursue technical/professional courses that guarantee placement with good income.</p>\n<p>Taking up a career in engineering or management is always lucrative. You can go for a wide range of engineering and management courses at NIET. NIET is one of the <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">top private engineering colleges in Noida</a>. It is a leading educational institution with proven placement records and great career opportunities for its graduates.</p>\n<p>The NIET\u2019s infrastructure is second to none.

According to the reviews made by former students of Noida Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology (NIET), the institute has the best record of placement and faculty of any engineering institute in the country (A grade, 3.23).</p>\n<p>As part of the Institute\u2019s commitment to education and outreach, special Centers of Competence have been established in collaboration with big corporates. A PLM Center of Excellence (CoE) by CAPGEMINI has been set up in the college\u2019s campus.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>Management courses have become more popular in recent years. MBA courses prepare students for successful careers and help them looking for new opportunities. When it comes to selecting the best MBA Colleges in Delhi/NCR, it is difficult because there are so many possibilities. However, we have attempted to make the search more comprehensive to provide students with the best MBA institution options. Students in India\u2019s capital city have a variety of possibilities, with colleges emphasizing practical learning more frequently than not.</p>\r\n<p>Allowing students to put what they\u2019ve learned into practice is critical for cultivating a sense of practical learning. In the end, it\u2019s not always the theory that helps; in most circumstances, how you implement the learning is just as important. An MBA is one of the most financially rewarding post-graduate degrees. Thus, it may be the finest choice. A master\u2019s degree in <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/business-administration\">business administration</a> allows you to make better market-based decisions while also gaining theoretical knowledge. After all, every company needs someone who can make decisions rather than just follow orders, and an MBA gives you the skills to do so with ease. Because there are too many colleges, we will talk about some important guidelines that should govern the choice.</p>\r\n<h2>Factors That Should Be Taken into Account While Choosing MBA Colleges in Delhi NCR:</h2>\r\n<p>Some of the most important requirements in this domain are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Quality of Education:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The most important thing which has to be taken into account when selecting an MBA college in Delhi NCR is that the quality of education should be at par. The basic reason you will be joining an MBA college is that you want to pursue a career in management, and having bit of knowledge in the field is indeed important. If the quality of education is not at par, then it is given that the result will not be promising as well.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Placements:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>When you pursue a professional degree like an MBA, it is important to remember that placements have to be taken care of. Hence, you must choose those colleges with an active placement cell and that can help students find jobs. Try to list among the\u00a0<a title=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/mba\" href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/mba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best MBA colleges for placement in NCR</a> and then eventually make a choice. Without having access to placement, it will be a complete waste of 2 years. The current job situations are not very favorable and hence make sure that your choice of college has tie-ups with good companies.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Faculty:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The next thing which is equally important when you choose among the MBA colleges in Delhi NCR is the faculty team who has been teaching. Remember that faculty will ensure that you can understand the subject better and realise your potential. If the faculty team of the college is not very well built, the overall output of the college will also not be considered.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Resources:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Lastly, another very important thing which has to be mentioned in this respect is that the college\u2019s resources should be up to the mark. In a course like an MBA, there is a lot of practical knowledge and exposure to practice. If the college you are choosing to pursue the degree does not offer you enough resources, it is almost a given that it will be a blockage for your full growth. Hence, we will always suggest that you have an idea of the resources and then go forth with the admission.</p>\r\n<h2>Trust NIET \u2013 The Leading Placement College in NCR</h2>\r\n<p>It is important to mention that all of these factors are specifically important when deciding on an MBA college in Delhi. However, we would suggest that you choose someone like NIET, known to be one of the best MBA colleges for placement in NCR\u00a0because ultimately, jobs are very important.</p>\r\n<p>Noida Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology (NIET) is undeniably the <a title=\"engineering institute in Greater Noida\" href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best engineering college in Greater Noida</a>. NIET has a strong foundation, and its infrastructure is second to none. It is the first private institute in Uttar Pradesh to get Autonomous status by UGC. The Institute is ranked 43rd Pharmacy and 171st in NIET Engineering PAN India by NIRF. The institute is also accredited by NAAC (A Grade, 3.23) and NBA (CSE, ECE, ME, IT, Biotechnology, B.Pharm, MBA and MCA),\u00a0 It is developing as the Center of Excellence imparting technical education and generating competent professionals with a high degree of credibility, integrity, and ethical standards.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t<p>Choosing an engineering college in Greater Noida is about more than just its prestige. It also has to do with the quality of education you\u2019ll receive, the opportunities you\u2019ll get, and even how much you\u2019ll pay while studying there! This guide will take you through everything you need to know before making your final decision, so check it out today!</p>\n<p><strong>Know your career goals</strong></p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to ask yourself and answer honestly, what do I want? It would be best if you were precise about your future job. Think of how your life would be during and after college. Opt for the right course for a better job opportunity. Choosing the right path that aligns with your values and interests could save you a lot of heartaches later on. Look for a course that lets you get involved, volunteer, or hold leadership positions. That will help you gain valuable experience and provide networking opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Select an appropriate course</strong></p>\n<p>To get an excellent start on your engineering degree, you must pick an appropriate course. The <a title=\"engineering institute in Greater Noida\" href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">best engineering institute in Greater Noida</a> offers many different specializations.

In contrast, civil engineers earn just over \u20b93,08,982 per year. The latter is almost half as much as they could potentially make by pursuing another specialization.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out the facilities at colleges</strong></p>\n<p>You\u2019re about to spend a lot of money on tuition, so it is wise to spend some time checking out the <em>best Btech colleges in Greater Noida</em>.

The path you choose can impact your future career and life goals, so it\u2019s essential to research colleges thoroughly before deciding.

Don\u2019t forget to make sure that it is close enough to the city. Or otherwise, you may have to go far when you need resources or tools for school projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Attend pre-admission workshops</strong></p>\n<p>Colleges usually offer a handful of pre-admission workshops, which can help you nail down your list of courses and learn about application deadlines. These events are a great way to meet with college representatives from nearby schools and make sure you\u2019re on track for submitting your applications by deadlines.

    "short_description": "<p>One great option you have in the field is NIET, and it is the quality of education that makes them one of the best colleges for BTech CSE in India.</p>",
    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>Computer science is one of the most promising fields, and the opportunities it offers to the aspirants are also quite amazing. At the same time, it is important to understand that even if you pass out from the\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/b-tech-in-cse\">best colleges for computer science in India</a>\u00a0</em>and do not have an aptitude for the field, you will not be able to render much or realize the job potential. In the booking industry, it has not become a cakewalk to make sure that pursuing a degree in computer science provides you with ample job opportunities and lets you earn a decent salary. Not only that, but if you are consistent and want to achieve more in the field, that will come with time and expertise in the domain.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What Are the Job Opportunities for Pursuing Computer Science?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Computer science is one field that has come forth with some of the most challenging and promising job roles which make sure that you can kickstart your career. Some of the best domains where you can make a career after completing a computer science degree are:</p>\r\n<h4>1. IT Technician:</h4>\r\n<p>IT is a sector that is consistently growing in the country. The best thing is that more companies based in this sector are coming forth and establishing their companies, laying the grounds for better job opportunities. Being an IT technician is one of the most promising and profoundly pursued fields, especially after pursuing a degree in computer science. The entire concept of being an IT technician is being an expert in the field and assisting all those who have some kind of problem with setting up or maintaining the system. Every office today has an IT team that makes sure that the system is running; else, it can make the company incur huge losses.</p>\r\n<h4>2. Web Developer:</h4>\r\n<p>When we talk about <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-engineering-in-computer-science-and-business-system/\">computer science</a> as a subject, the one thing that is taught in-depth is the website\u2019s functioning and how it is developed. Hence being a website developer is also a great option because every business today needs a website. You can easily choose to get connected with a web development-based company and, at the same time, choose to work as a freelancer. Numerous people belong to the computer science background, and yet they have opened up some amazing startups which have helped them to establish their careers.</p>\r\n<h4>3. Software Engineer:</h4>\r\n<p>When we talk about probable career prospects after pursuing computer science, inevitably, we will not talk about the domain of becoming a software engineer. A software engineer is concerned with the software development of the system, and not only that, they tend to maintain the same as well. Being a software engineer pays you quite well in India, and if you have a bit of expertise in the field, the range goes up more.</p>\r\n<h4>4. Computer Scientists:</h4>\r\n<p>Finally, if we talk about a more academia-oriented career after pursuing computer science, then it has to be the field of computer science. Here the individuals are vested with the task of studying in-depth computer mechanics, and they even tend to develop more potent solutions for existing problems. Some of the <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/b-tech-in-cse\">best computer engineering colleges in India</a> even employ them to work as researchers with the institution.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p><em>If you want to pursue the field, it is imperative that you first pursue the degree. One great option you have in the field is NIET, and it is the quality of education that makes them one of the\u00a0best colleges for BTech CSE in India.\u00a0</em>So, get in touch with their counsellors today to seek further guidance of the subject.</p>\r\n<h3>Also Read about:\u00a0</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/2022/04/22/what-makes-niet-the-best-placement-college-in-delhi-ncr/\">Best Placement College in Delhi NCR UP</a></p>\r\n</div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>Recently, the job market has become more aggressive at a different level. One of the major reasons behind this is the ever-changing nature of technology. If you are unable to upskill your knowledge or stay advanced with the emerging changes in the industry, you will inevitably lose your change to sustain.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Besides, the other reason being the cut-throat competition of the job opportunities.

To ensure that students gain the maximum benefit from a particular program of learning, AI may adjust based on their expertise, pace, and intended goals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Automating Basic or Repetitive Activities</strong></p>\r\n<p>By leveraging AI technology, almost all types of assessment questions including MCQs and fill-in-the-blank tests can now be graded automatically in the shortest time possible. This set of features will grow further as essay-grading software evolves.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Tutoring</strong></p>\r\n<p>We all know the fact that many students need additional assistance besides their routine classes and sometimes teachers struggle to assist these students as they don\u2019t get enough time. AI technique can be easily implemented here.</p>\r\n<p>AI programs can help students improve their skills outside of the classroom by assisting with solving difficult sums and clearing doubts. It offers students a one-on-one experience of learning, without the need for a teacher to be available to answer questions 24\u00d77. A bot driven by AI can also respond to requests in 2.7 seconds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Quick Responses</strong></p>\r\n<p>Teachers and instructors are frequently bombarded with repetitive questions making it difficult to clear doubts of each student at a time. To solve this problem, AI automation can give answers to frequently asked questions of students with the help of cognitive intelligence.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Universal 24/7 Access</strong></p>\r\n<p>AI-powered solutions add flexibility which allows all students to access learning material or courses at any time and from any location. Each student can progress at his or her own level, and having access anytime allows children to experiment with what works best for them without waiting for a teacher.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Time management for Educators</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mostly, teachers and instructors admit that they struggle with managing their time, and they often end up having a long list of activities on their daily to-do lists. Artificial intelligence can help teachers save time by automating tasks, analyzing student performances, and eliminating educational gaps.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Getting instant feedback</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sometimes teachers are not aware of how their lectures and instructional materials may leave students confused. This problem can be solved using artificial intelligence. When a large number of students submit wrong responses to an activity, the system notifies the teacher and delivers a personalized message with suggestions for the proper response to future students.</p>\r\n<p>This method fills in the explanation gaps that can occur in courses and guarantees that all students are learning the same concept fundamentally. Instead of waiting for the educator to respond, students receive quick feedback that assists them in learning a topic and remembering how to do it correctly the next time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Task Automation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Among the other things, AI automates include grading papers, identifying patterns of learning, answering common questions, etc. Rather than focusing on arranging all these things, teachers can employ support automation systems to automate manual duties, freeing up time to focus on developing their teaching skills.</p>\r\n<p><strong>9. Reducing Academic and Social Pressures</strong></p>\r\n<p>AI systems, which are frequently based on trial and error, can assist in creating a kind of environment where students are not forced to compare themselves to their peers. It makes students more confident about their learnings, skills, and knowledge.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10. Produce Smart Content</strong></p>\r\n<p>AI can assist teachers in creating smart content that makes learning material more engaging for learners. AI can assist in the creation of small-size learning material, study guides, and digital textbooks, all within the context of digital learning. It also enables multiple ways of providing the information, such as modeling and visualization. Additionally, AI can develop and update learning content on a regular basis that helps to provide up-to-date information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n<p>As we can see today, AI is drastically altering the dynamics of learning and teaching, and the possibilities are that learning will soon be completely shifting from traditional classrooms to digital classrooms due to its multiple benefits.<br>However, if someone wants to learn AI, it is critical to grasp the role of artificial intelligence, which is a fantastic job option for many who want to learn AI and work in a similar industry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Build your career with Artificial Intelligence at NIET</strong></p>\r\n<p>NIET offers\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/btech-in-cse-artificial-intelligence\"> Btech in Artificial Intelligence\u00a0</a> courses from which you can learn everything about AI and can build a lucrative career.

Industry 4.0 is a mechanical engineering movement that focuses on data interchange and automation in manufacturing processes and technology.</p>\r\n<p>As Industry 4.0 becomes more widely implemented, mechanical engineers looking to the future will benefit from a thorough understanding of the new technologies involved with it. Employees will have additional options to upskill and develop their careers as more organization implement these technologies.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>What is the Role of Mechanical Engineers in Industry 4.0?</h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The mechanical engineering business has always been a powerhouse, requiring strong mechanical engineers to sustain industry growth. While the sector\u2019s skill requirements are evolving due to digitization, mechanical engineering knowledge remains in great demand.</p>\r\n<p>While Industry 4.0 has been revolutionizing industrial operations for several years, no one could have predicted the digital acceleration that Covid-19 has brought. Many firms are increasingly looking to these technologies to assist recover and restore lost earnings, while they were previously regarded non-urgent due to the time, money, and expertise required to implement them.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://niet.co.in/blog/what-does-a-mechanical-engineer-do-roles-and-responsibilities/\">What Does a Mechanical Engineer Do (Roles and Responsibilities)?</a></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Emerging Trends in Mechanical Engineering in Industry 4.0</h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The following are some of the recent trends in mechanical engineering of Industry 4.0:</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>1. Additive Manufacturing (AM) or 3D Printing:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Additive manufacturing, one of the emerging trends of Industry 4.0 adds material to a 3D item, as the name implies. 3D Printing is another name for additive manufacturing. Additive Manufacturing is a method in which an object\u2019s model is built in any modelling software (CAD software) and saved in the .STL format. Standard Triangular Language is abbreviated as .STL. The item is \u201csliced\u201d into ultra-thin layers in this way. Each subsequent layer of partially melted or molten material adheres to the previous layer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Interconnected Machines:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Machines interconnected or Machine to Machine (M2M) in the sense that there is direct communication between devices through a communication channel, whether wired or wireless. Machines Interconnection refers to the industrial instrumentation that allows sensors to exchange data. The growth of IP networks has made machine-to-machine communication faster and easier all across the world while consuming less power. These networks provide suppliers and consumers with new business prospects.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Internet of Things (IoT):</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is one of the advanced trends in mechanical engineering, in this system, no human interaction is required. Every system is controlled by devices that are connected to it. It is a system of mechanical and digital equipment that have been given unique identifiers (UIDs) in order to transfer data across a variety of networks. Wireless sensor networks, embedded systems, automation, control systems, and other traditional fields all contribute to enabling the Internet of Things. Thermostats, security systems, automobiles, alarm clocks, electronic appliances, lights in business and residential settings, vending machines, speaker systems, and other devices are examples.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Smart Factory:</strong></p>\r\n<p>A smart factory is an IoT idea that envisions a manufacturing environment as a completely automated and intelligent network of systems that allows facilities, machines, and logistical chains within the manufacturing facility to be operated without human interaction. Furthermore, a smart factory is a location where all of these things occur as a result of data exchange between all elements in the production technology chain, not only between production tools and machines. This, in turn, supports machine learning, allowing operations to be carried out more efficiently and cost-effectively than they could be if humans entirely supervised production processes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Data Visualization:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Although the importance of data visualization as a tool for I4.0 is widely recognized and well documented, many manufacturing industries have been slow to adopt such tools, possibly due to a lack of skills and knowledge. Manufacturing contains complicated multivariate systems that generate large volumes of high-velocity data, posing a tremendous computing challenge to assemble, evaluate, and obtain insight into this data; for many, returning real-time process knowledge is a daunting undertaking. Clearly, the creation of one-stop-shop solutions that provide a bird\u2019s-eye view of enormous datasets delivers crucial process insight in a far more efficient manner.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Big Data Analytics and Advanced Algorithms:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Addressing the majority of the\u00a0innovation issues requires digital transformation, which is one of Industry 4.0\u2019s pillars. It demonstrates the methodology, development, and implementation of a new cloud computing platform for collecting, storing, and processing data from store floors. Manufacturing shop floors employ connected, intelligent gadgets that generate thousands of data points that, once computed, provide a significant amount of value. The platform is created with the goal of reducing the complexity and expenses associated with its deployment.<br><strong>Read More:</strong>\u00a0<a style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://niet.co.in/blog/mechanical-engineering-a-good-career-choice-undoubtedly/\">Mechanical Engineering: A Good Career Choice, Undoubtedly!</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\r\n<p>As these technologies advance, new opportunities for experienced engineers will emerge. According to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, employment in the engineering business is expected to expand by 3% between 2019 and 2029, adding about 75,000 new positions.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<h4><strong>\u2018</strong><em>To be employed is to be at risk, to be employable is to be secure</em><strong>\u2019</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The Art of Building Windmills, Peter Hawkins (1999)</p>\r\n<p>The biggest challenge in India\u2019s growth and future is the shortage of the skilled employees across the industries. According to NASSCOM, each year over 3 million graduates and post-graduates are added to the Indian workforce. However, of these <b>only 25 percent of technical graduates and 10-15 percent of other graduates are considered employable</b> by the rapidly growing IT and ITES segments. The need of industry is knowledge and skills acquired with an eligibility to include skill-ready employees from day one. So, what we have today is a growing skills gap reflecting very small availability of high-quality college education in India and the multi-fold growth pace of the country\u2019s service-driven economy, which is growing faster than most countries in the world. Thus, there is a need felt for the integration of job learning, and thus creating\u00a0 a need for customized programs for the industry.</p>\r\n<p>Since businesses are planning to increase their workforce two-to-three times, India is facing challenges in maintaining its position in the global marketplace. To maintain the sustenance, it has become important to have an innovative, competent and talented workforce of world-class standards.</p>\r\n<p>One cannot ignore that to sustain the economic development and social presence in the knowledge society, knowledge, skills, and resourcefulness of the people is very critical. Given the current high-paced growth and dynamic investment climate in India, the demand for knowledge workers with high levels of technical and soft skills will only increase.</p>\r\n<p>The spectra of a severe shortage of trained, skilled and knowledge workers is haunting India Inc. While demographics weigh in the country\u2019s favor, quality of workforce does not. A look at the Indian education system will reveal that the number of technical schools in India, including engineering colleges, has actually more than trebled in the last decade, according to the All India Council of Technical Education. Ironically, creating a robust and continuous pipeline of talent has become even harder. The best and most selective universities generate too few graduates, and new private colleges are producing graduates of uneven quality. In this scenario, will industry-academia partnerships bridge the demand-supply gap?</p>\r\n<p>Further, <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">universities and educational institutions have been unable to update their syllabi in tune with the high speed changes taking place in the technological world</b>. Hence, the students churned out are not equipped to meet the current industry requirements and often companies have to incur additional expenses (time and monetary) to train new hires. Corporate houses also feel the need for a stronger element of vocational training. Besides the technology aspect industries also evaluate competencies ranging soft skills, team building, overall attitude, and values. Success of countries like Japan and Germany can be attributed to the presence of a strong vocational training set-up.</p>\r\n<p>Simply put, getting a degree, and putting a few letters after your name is just not enough to land you that plum job, or to launch your career.\u00a0 What you need is a portfolio of employability skills.\u00a0 <b>Employers like to recruit graduates who have gone the \u2018extra mile\u2019, \u2018joined in\u2019, can work both individually and in a team, shown a capacity for leadership, and demonstrated a willingness to take risks by spending time travelling, and experiencing new situations and culturesThe success of individuals in a knowledge-based economy will increasingly depend upon skills, creativity and imagination.\u00a0</b> While basic literacy, numeracy, technical skills craft skills remain vital, today\u2019s economy and society increasingly demands people with an ability to cope with change and adapt quickly to new environments.</p>\r\n<p>Academic curriculum does not necessarily prepare individuals adequately for these workplace requirements. The ever increasing demand for skilled professionals and domain specialization has led to innovation within the academic space. The good news is that, while many soft skills are inherent, others can be learned. You can train yourself just as you can in hard skills.</p>\r\n<p>There are also courses on communication skills that can not only teach you some soft skills but help you demonstrate to employers, self-awareness and initiative simply by the fact you have signed up. If you are shy, for example, get involved in debating societies and other clubs at school and university. <b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Soft skills are what make your personal brand but you need to think about them.</b> Instead of thinking, for example, \u2018I have only worked at McDonald\u2019s\u2019, think \u2018What did working at McDonald\u2019s teach me?\u2019 For employers, getting the right people means identifying people with the right skills and qualities to fulfil the role and contribute to the organization\u2019s success.\u00a0<b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Candidates may have the qualifications and \u2018hard skills\u2019 needed to be able to manage the job role but, without a well-honed set of \u2018soft skills\u2019, employers are less inclined to hire.</b></p>\r\n</div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t<p><strong>BRIDGING GAP BETWEEN MARKET AND ACADEMIA BY NAZUK ENDLAY</strong></p>\n<p>India, the nation of growth is considered to be one of the emerging superpowers of the world with approximately 1.5 million engineers trained for the job market every year. With the growing economy, India is also witnessing the growth of educational sector. However, Indian industry is still looking for reforms for betterment of job-readiness of the graduates.<br>\nThere is an urgent need that the industry and academia come together and address some of the underlying challenges. Though educational institutions are preparing millions of students for the corporate requirements with new and innovative internships and training programs yet there lies a question over the existent gap between the corporate requirements and the academia.<br>\nThe intersecting requirements and jointly inter-reliant relationship requires identifying means of further improvement in academia-market partnerships.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Points of Concern:</strong></p>\n<p><b>Syllabus:</b><br>\nEngineering courses in India are still tuned with the traditional way of teaching. Although, new teaching methods and programs are improving things at the grass-roots level, but further reforms are required to improve the employability of candidates.</p>\n<p><b>Faculty Requirements:</b><br>\nThe traditional way of teaching engineering doesn\u2019t let teachers to evolve. It is true that basics are important, but in this fast-pace world it is important to gain some pragmatic experience before entering the job market. Teachers need to impart this side of academia and for that, they will require training beforehand to improve the overall situation.</p>\n<p><b>Improvement in Innovation and Research:</b><br>\nOur students think more about the result rather than fun learning. They are taught technologies that are not relevant in the 21st century which makes engineering boring. They are high on potential and talent but, lack the \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d thinking attitude with no inclination towards innovation and research. The things are improving on this horizon with Government of India and corporate houses providing funding for research and ensuring a brighter future for the scientists in India.</p>\n<p><b>Skill Based Learning:</b><br>\nEducation in India is still majorly theory oriented. We have observed some breakthroughs in Indian engineering academia with several competitions such as go-karting, robotics etc. But, students are still not aware of on how to apply theory in day-to-day life. They lack skills to get employed.</p>\n<p><b>Soft Skills:</b><br>\nOne the major problem arising is the continual ignorance of soft skills which are major factor when it comes to corporate employability. Students focus only on the result of placement; they spend all their time focusing on subject curriculum.</p>\n<p><strong>Panacea:</strong></p>\n<p><b>Aligning Curriculum with Industry:</b><br>\nThe imperative need to re-structure the existent educational system is to address the varied needs of the dynamic industry. The curriculum needs to be regularly revised and developed in accordance with the market needs.</p>\n<p><b>Shift to Practical Learning :</b><br>\nThe classroom methodology and theory inclined approach needs to be reoriented with making the entire approach more dynamic with the help of practical hands-on learning.</p>\n<p><b>Workplace Exposure :</b><br>\nNeed to increase exposure of students to industries and market by simultaneous practical implementation through internships, live projects and corporate interactions.</p>\n<p><b>Channel Industry Challenges:</b><br>\nChanneling some real-time industry challenges and problems to students as add-on to the curriculum; can help students to crack interviews and big jobs in the future.</p>\n<p><b>Focus on Soft Skills :</b><br>\nBesides learning of core or technical knowledge, academia should also focus on the overall development of the student including soft and behavioral skills such as leadership capabilities, attitude, professional communication and interpersonal skills.</p>\n<p>Its high time now for us to recalibrate the Indian education system with modern methods of teaching and training. Collaboration of industry and academia will play an important part in tapping the gap between what is given to what is actually needed.</p>\n\t</div>",

Kennedy</p>\n<p>Education plays a significant role in the growth of a nation. In a country like India education and knowledge have always been given substantial value. In ancient India, the aim of education was to\u00a0develop the pupil\u2019s personality, his\u00a0innate and latent capacities as a process of one\u2019s inner growth and self-fulfillment. The education system also needs to transform according to the ever-changing needs of the society and the world. Thus, for the overall development of the education in and the progress of the nation, a proper policy is needed. The\u00a0National Policy on Education (NPE)\u00a0is a\u00a0policy\u00a0formulated by the\u00a0Government of India\u00a0to promote education amongst India\u2019s people. The policy covers elementary education to the colleges in both rural and urban India. The first NPE was promulgated by the\u00a0Government of India\u00a0by Prime Minister\u00a0Indira Gandhi\u00a0in 1968, the second by Prime Minister\u00a0Rajiv Gandhi\u00a0in 1986, and the third by Prime Minister\u00a0Narendra Modi\u00a0in 2020. The National\u00a0Education\u00a0Policy 2020 (NEP) brings\u00a0reform\u00a0after 34 years, especially in higher\u00a0education, shifting focus from academic to non-academic activities. An\u00a0NPE\u00a0is a comprehensive framework to guide the development of education in the country. Recently, the Union Cabinet has approved the\u00a0new National Education Policy (NEP), 2020\u00a0with an aim to introduce several changes in the Indian education system \u2013\u00a0from the school to college level. The NEP 2020 aims at making\u00a0\u201cIndia a global knowledge superpower\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Cabinet has approved the\u00a0renaming\u00a0of the Ministry of Human Resource Development to the\u00a0Ministry of Education.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br>\n<strong>School Education:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Universalization\u00a0of education from\u00a0preschool to secondary level\u00a0with\u00a0100% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)\u00a0in school education by\u00a02030.</li>\n<li>2 crores out of school children are going to be brought back into the mainstream through an\u00a0open schooling system.</li>\n<li>The current\u00a010+2 system is going\u00a0to be\u00a0replaced\u00a0with a new\u00a05+3+3+4\u00a0curricular structure corresponding to\u00a0ages 3-8, 8-11, 11-14, and 14-18 years respectively.</li>\n<li>The uncovered age group of\u00a03-6 years which is being recognized globally as the\u00a0crucial\u00a0stage for the development of mental faculties of a child, is also considered\u00a0under school curriculum,</li>\n<li>It will also have 12 years of schooling with three years of Anganwadi/ pre schooling.</li>\n<li>The board examinations of Class 10 and 12 are to be made easier,\u00a0to test core competencies rather than memorized facts, with all students allowed to\u00a0take the exam twice.</li>\n<li>School governance\u00a0is set to change, with a\u00a0new accreditation framework and an independent authority\u00a0to regulate both public and private schools.</li>\n<li>Emphasis on\u00a0Foundational Literacy and Numeracy,\u00a0no rigid separation between academic streams, extracurricular, vocational streams in schools.</li>\n<li>Vocational Education\u00a0to start from\u00a0Class 6 with Internships.</li>\n<li>Teaching up to at\u00a0least Grade 5\u00a0to be in\u00a0mother tongue/regional language.\u00a0No language will be imposed on any student.</li>\n<li>Assessment reforms with\u00a0360 degree Holistic Progress Card,\u00a0tracking Student Progress for achieving Learning Outcomes</li>\n<li>A new and comprehensive\u00a0National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education (NCFTE) 2021,\u00a0will be formulated by the\u00a0National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE)\u00a0in consultation with\u00a0National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Teacher Education:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year integrated B.Ed. degree.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Higher Education:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gross Enrolment Ratio\u00a0in higher education to be\u00a0raised to 50% by 2035.\u00a0Also,\u00a03.5 crore seats\u00a0to be added in higher education.</li>\n<li>The\u00a0current\u00a0Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education is\u00a026.3%.</li>\n<li>Holistic Undergraduate education with a flexible curriculum can be of\u00a03 or 4 years with multiple exit options\u00a0and appropriate certification within this period.</li>\n<li>M.Phil\u00a0courses will be\u00a0discontinued\u00a0and all the courses at undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD level will now be interdisciplinary.</li>\n<li>Academic Bank of Credits\u00a0to be established to facilitate Transfer of Credits.</li>\n<li>Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs),\u00a0at par with IITs, IIMs, to be set up as models of best multidisciplinary education of global standards in the country.</li>\n<li>The\u00a0National Research Foundation\u00a0will be created as an\u00a0apex body\u00a0for fostering a strong research culture and building research capacity across higher education.</li>\n<li>Higher Education Commission of India (HECI)\u00a0will be set up as a\u00a0single umbrella body\u00a0for the entire higher education,\u00a0excluding medical and legal education.\u00a0Public and private higher education institutions will be governed by the\u00a0same set of norms\u00a0for regulation, accreditation and academic standards.

We are now at the cusp of a revolution through which robots will give us complete freedom from laborious, mundane tasks such as cleaning, cooking, or even taking care of our kids on the days you aren\u2019t feeling up for it.</p>\r\n<h3>What is Robotics?</h3>\r\n<p>A robot is an automatic mechanical device guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry which enables it to perform tasks assigned to it. It is a system that contains sensors, control systems, manipulators, power supplies and software, all of which work together.</p>\r\n<p>Robotics is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><b style=\"display: inline-block;\">Robotics</b> is design,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/construction\">construction</a>, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-being\">human</a>\u00a0beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks and in industries where\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/work-economics\">work</a>\u00a0must be performed in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environments\">environments</a>\u00a0hazardous to humans.

It basically involves the concept of Programming, Mathematics, Design, Electronics and much more. It can be summarized as the mixture of all sort of engineering you can name (except a few). But if you are designing a robot for some specific application, you might need to study that particular branch too.</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Robotic Engineering</h3>\r\n<p>Robotics engineers, like any other professions in the engineering discipline, will need to be strong in math and sciences. However, most people think that engineers are just whizzes at math and science from the get-go, but that\u2019s rarely ever the case. For most engineers, at least the ones that complete their degrees, they aren\u2019t the people that are best at math naturally, they\u2019re the ones that stuck it out and put in the hard work.</p>\r\n<p><em>This field has a vast range of job opportunities for the aspiring candidates.\u201d</em></p>\r\n<p>After completing the degree/diploma or vocational course in this field, you can take jobs in manufacturing, maintenance, research of nuclear power plants and many other areas. Due to the advancement of technology, this robotics technology is used in space exploration, power plant maintenance,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sarvgyan.com/courses/engineering/automotive-engineering\">automobile</a>\u00a0industry,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sarvgyan.com/courses/engineering/petroleum-engineering\">Petroleum</a>\u00a0exploring places, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Plenty of job opportunities are available for robotics engineers both in India as well as in abroad countries.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t<p><strong>Life in lockdown</strong><br>\nThe global lockdown has made us confined to our primeval cave-like shelter of home. The post-global earth is in suspended condition as if it needs some time for hibernation. Surely the world will change permanently after this and if we are fortunate enough to see the post-Corona world, we will reminisce about our pre-Corona days. These are unprecedented times, a never-before, and perhaps never-after world that we now live in. Groping in the dark, in this age of social distancing, we have got the time to reflect on our idiosyncrasies. How do we transform ourselves from the flashy Joneses and beard ourselves in our dens? Let us accept the newfound world as it is, and hope against hope. Youth is the most precious resource of a country. They are the future, current times are challenging for them the sudden change in the educational system has affected not just their lives but even their psyche.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect of COVID-19 on Education System</strong><br>\nIndeed, a sudden jolt, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities, and colleges. According to the UNICEF monitoring, 106 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 55 are implementing local closures, impacting about 98.6 percent of the world\u2019s student population. Approximately 1.6 billion children and youngsters are unable to attend physical schools due to temporary closures and lockdowns.</p>\n<p>There is a severe impact of coronavirus on higher education. Universities and college campuses are the places where students live and study in close proximity to each other. They are also buzzing cultural hubs where students are brought together from nations around the world. Recently, the foundations of this unique ecosystem have been impacted significantly by the rapid spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, creating uncertainty regarding the implications for higher education. Over the past weeks, education officials have been forced to cancel classes and close the doors to campuses across the world in response to the growing coronavirus pandemic. But, knowledge cannot be confined within the boundaries even during the lockdown. This phase can be utilized by our youth to learn, enhance their knowledge, and upgrade their skills, so that one can become future ready, to take up the new challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Invest your time in learning</strong><br>\nIn the \u201clive with COVID\u201d era, a lot of options will be forced to develop to replace the conventional style of functioning of man-machine and knowledge delivery. The year 1985 implemented the digitalizing of education in India by the central government. DIGITAL INDIA projects are playing a conspicuous role in imparting education.</p>\n<p>Conferencing apps such as Zoom, Google Classroom, Google Meet, and Webex are the popular apps used for conducting interactive classes. All India Radio is broadcasting syllabus based educational contents daily in its VIDHYABHYASA RANGAM program. Television channels reach out to students in a better way since they can telecast video, multimedia content and audio simultaneously. For example, Doordarshan in collaboration with the government of Bihar started a programme named MERA DOORDARSHAN MERA VIDHYALAY. This programme is a big hit in states where education facilities in rural areas are less. \u2018Diksha\u2019 an educational programme by MHRD is conducting various courses for lessons, plans, etc. can be accessed from DIKSHA and teachers can easily upload educational resources created by them. NATIONAL REPOSITORY OF OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES (NROER) established in 2013 by MHRD and developed by NCERT is also an open resource platform for digital resources for class 1 to 12.</p>\n<p>Video audio documents and interactive contents are available online. SWAYAM is a programme initiated by the Government of India aimed at offering everyone, easy access to high-quality digital aides and resources. Premier government organizations host this programme. Subject-specific courses conducted by SWAYAM are available free of cost to the learners. Undergraduate education supported by NPTEL, AICTE, CEC, IIM Bangalore. Postgraduate education supported by NPTEL,AICTE, IIM Bangalore, and UGC. UGC has started promoting online courses by higher educational institutions. The distance education bureau of UGC is managing these programmes. Various universities and SCERTs are also supporting digital education in all possible ways. One can access a large volume of digital resources from YouTube and other social media platforms. YouTube is the largest source of digital learning material. Take the membership of free Digital libraries.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge or Opportunity?</strong><br>\nIt is not doom and gloom phase completely. Every challenge comes with some hidden opportunities. This time can be utilized by the youth to develop their skills, learn from the rich resources available to them. No barriers can stop the youth from learning and attaining knowledge. With the hope that the educational institutions will reopen soon and then things will be back to normal. As the students are coming into terms with the new normal the educational institutes are also gearing up.</p>\n<p>Universities and colleges are also implementing changes to campuses in response to the novel coronavirus. The steps are already being taken by the educators to understand what has worked, what hasn\u2019t worked, and how to tackle the challenges they may face. With the spread of the disease expected to worsen before it gets better, administrators are taking quick action to safeguard their campuses and students.<br>\nThe campuses are also ensuring safety and are preparing themselves for the new normal, measures like sanitization tunnels, temperature checks, monitoring safety by technology surveillance, rigorous campus cleansing, etc. are being implemented for the safety.</p>\n<p>The higher education sector has withstood turbulent economic times in the past, and it withstands them again. In a digital age, universities and colleges are better placed today more than ever to provide students with easy access to continue their studies online. They are ready to prepare their students for post corona times and are thus coming up with courses on trending technologies such as IoT, AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc. which will be in high demand in the market and this demand is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decade.</p>\n<p><strong>Hoping against hope</strong><br>\nThe youth today is unable to hang out with their friends, peers, and classmates like they used to, and are not being able to expend their energy on sports, is not be easy on them. They have to cope up with the new mechanisms, build and strengthen their connections with supportive adults, including their teachers. Things will be back to normal one day.\u201cHope begins in the dark. The stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don\u2019t give up.\u201d \u2013 Anne Lamott, Novelist</p>\n\t</div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>NIET has become the first private institute in Uttar Pradesh to have received autonomous status by the renowned UGC from New Delhi. The institute is already famous because it imparts an extraordinary level of education supported by highly experienced faculty members and efficient academic resources. Now, let us learn how NIET transforms higher education in the state with its autonomous status.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding the Autonomous Status</h2>\r\n<p>According to the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), any college or institute in India with a CGPA between 3.51 and 4 is considered to have autonomous status.</p>\r\n<p>However, certain institutes accredited in three or more programs and a score of 750 or above are automatically declared autonomous by the University Grant Council (UGC). This happens if the score applies to every program and the institute is certified by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA). UGC grants the institutes an autonomous status after the recommendation of a NITI Aayog Committee. For the unversed, NITI is a public policy decision-maker for the government of India.</p>\r\n<p>NIET, the best college for B.Tech in UP, was declared an autonomous institute when it received \u2018GRADE A\u2019 with a CGPA of 3.23. Moreover, it is the only state institute with four different government accreditations.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of NIET\u2019s Autonomous Status</h2>\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, NIET has transformed the scene of higher education in the state with its autonomous status. Here are the benefits of achieving an autonomous status:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The NIET modules have the edge in this respect since they can decide for themselves to fill the empty space in the course by creating an entirely new course module or a revised syllabus.</li>\r\n<li>The institute should be treated as an independent legal body that runs all its responsibilities independently, without being influenced by a third party.</li>\r\n<li>The instructors of this college are able to create customized classes and work out respective assignment structures without any template restriction. Indeed, they cannot only do that but may even write papers and sit for their exams.</li>\r\n<li>The institute also offers B.Tech., M.Tech., and PhD degrees at the undergraduate, postgraduate, and postdoctoral levels, respectively.</li>\r\n<li>Once a degree or diploma is completed, the reward certificate from the associated university, which is connected to NIET, one of the <a href=\"SITE_URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"blog-content-full\">top engineering colleges in UP</a>, will be given.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Future Implications of NIET\u2019s Autonomous Status</h2>\r\n<p>The future of higher education in Uttar Pradesh is brighter. Here is how NIET aims to bring further transformations in the education system through its innovative techniques and strategies. Here are some implications that may grab everyone\u2019s attention:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Enhanced Academic Flexibility:</strong> NIET, the best college for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"blog-content-full\">B.Tech</a> in UP, benefits from full autonomy regarding new programs and innovations. This resonates with the pace of technological improvements and the shifting needs of industries. Furthermore, it applies trending technologies to the curriculum and thus provides provisions for industry skills development activities. As a result, students get experience in problem-oriented and job-oriented education.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Research and Innovation Hub:</strong> NIET, as an autonomous entity, helps cultivate a culture of research and innovation within its academic community. The institute can divert funds and formulate research centers, labs, and collaborations with industry members to provide a platform for research that cuts across various disciplines. Thus, space for study and authorship of scientific articles is allocated for the faculty and students.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Global Recognition and Collaboration:</strong> NIET\u2019s autonomous position paves the way for it to be the country\u2019s premier university. It has a high potential for attracting national and international exposure and cooperative chances. The institute is one of the top engineering colleges in UP that can make alliances with famous universities, research establishments, and enterprises to incorporate joint research projects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n<p>NIET has come a long way in enhancing how education is imparted in the state. With its autonomous status, the institute will pave better ways for students to pursue their academics and become proficient professionals. So, if you want to enhance your career at one of the topmost institutes in India, NIET is your place!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Also Read About:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"SITE_URLcourse/b-tech-in-cse\">Best Colleges for Computer Engineering</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"SITE_URLblog/how-to-identify-the-top-10-engineering-colleges-for-b-tech-programs-in-greater-noida/\">Top 5 Engineering Colleges in Noida</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"SITE_URLblog/why-niet-ranks-among-top-10-private-engineering-colleges-greater-noida-unveiling-success-factors/\">Top Private B.Tech Colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n</div>",

There are two main courses i.e. PGDM full form is Post-Graduate Diploma in Management and MBA which stands for Master of Business Administration.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Students are generally confused between the two as they do not understand their basic differences. So before moving on to the difference between PGDM and MBA let\u2019s understand what both of them mean.</p>\r\n<h2>An Overview of PGDM Course Details</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/niet-pgdm/\">PGDM </a> full form is a Post Graduate Diploma in Management Studies.

This helps colleges to ensure that the syllabus is suitable as per industry standards.</li>\r\n<li>However, the PGDM course duration is of 2-year diploma program but it has a governing authority named \u201cAICTCE\u201d that ensures that the students of the PGDM course are getting the right practical exposure that the program tends to offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>An Overview of MBA Course Details</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/mba-programmes.php\"> MBA </a> stands for Master of Business Administration. It is a two-year postgraduate degree program that gives a comprehensive management education.</li>\r\n<li>MBA programs are offered by colleges that are affiliated with some kind of universities as well. They have a strict curriculum and the syllabus is usually not revised frequently.</li>\r\n<li>The MBA program curriculum is more theoretical based and covers wide essential areas including finance, marketing, human resources, business analytics, supply chain, and many others</li>\r\n<li>MBA provides career opportunities in various fields including marketing, finance, supply chain, and more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Key Differences Between PGDM and MBA</h2>\r\n<h4>Affiliation and Autonomy</h4>\r\n<p>PGDM can only be provided by autonomous universities while MBA can only be provided when they are affiliated to some kind of university.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>In the modern world, where research and education are advancing at a rapid pace, there is an increasing need for high-quality education. The phrase \u201cautonomous institute\u201d is becoming more and more commonplace every day. Being independent from external control entails having the capacity for self-regulation and authority. The Autonomous Institute works hard to give its students the best education possible.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The Autonomous Institute brings value to research and academic aspects. The autonomous college list is very vast. There are around 252+ autonomous colleges in India. One in the autonomous college list is <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">NIET,</a>\u00a0 an autonomous college that provides many courses such as B.TECH, PGDM, MBA, MCA, BBA, BCA, B.PHARMA, and BBA+MBA Integrated to provide and impart knowledge in these renowned courses.NIET is the best autonomous college in engineering in India. The private or government-autonomous college in engineering is stated based on its accreditation and affiliation.\u00a0</p>\r\n<h2>Definition of Autonomous Institute</h2>\r\n<p>Autonomous Institutes are not like traditional universities. To deliver high-quality instruction and conduct cutting-edge research, autonomous institutes are granted complete autonomy and independent authority over all aspects of their daily operations, including fees, regulations, and courses. Autonomous institutes possess the liberty to make judgments and employ departmental expertise at will.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>An autonomous institute is a kind of institution that can design its curriculum, develop its own admissions policies, frame its exams, conduct evaluations, set its fees, and handle admissions. Stated differently, an autonomous institute possesses the authority to execute and enforce complete autonomy over its daily activities or procedures.</p>\r\n<p>These independent institutions are not required to adhere to the government-recommended curriculum. Unlike state universities, which are fully managed and funded by the government, autonomous institutes do not submit their scoresheets to a \u201cboard\u201d or other regulatory authority. This includes both the independent admissions procedure and the individual exam schedule.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of Autonomous Institute</h2>\r\n<p>The general development of an institution and the career of its students are significantly influenced by the caliber of its faculty and facilities, which include excellent instruction, labs, and classrooms. Because they have self-governing authority, autonomous institutes are flexible in how they create, deliver, and evaluate their curricula and typically incorporate the most recent research methods.\u00a0 These educational institutions use autonomy to improve the growth of their students.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\u00a0One advantage of an autonomous college is its freedom to determine what is best for its students and the institution as a whole.</li>\r\n<li>The syllabus is maintained based on the course requirements. Certain issues are not covered needlessly.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\r\n<li>Independent educational institutions conduct their exams and create their own set of questions and grading guidelines.</li>\r\n<li>Compared to traditional colleges, an autonomous college can handle internal exams more easily. since they are in total control of the format of the exam.</li>\r\n<li>Compared to other universities, the caliber of the lab equipment and facilities is higher.</li>\r\n<li>Institutes with autonomy can adjust to shifting student demands and offer pertinent instruction to raise the standard of instruction.</li>\r\n<li>Compared to other universities, the caliber of the lab equipment and facilities is higher.</li>\r\n<li>Autonomous institutes can adapt to the change in educational needs, and provide relevant education to enhance the quality of education.</li>\r\n<li>Generally speaking, autonomous institutions provide exam results a month following the test, and failing students will be retested right away.\u00a0</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Criteria for Autonomous Institute</h2>\r\n<p>First and foremost, only reputable institutions with superior academic standing are granted autonomy, which is why students there are thought to receive higher-quality education. A strong institutional identity and mission can also be fostered by having the self-governing capacity to improve autonomy. Common requirements for an autonomous institute included, for example :\u00a0</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Good Infrastructure</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>An autonomous institution has the infrastructure needed to support innovative research, administration, and the teaching process. These independent schools feature first-rate resources like labs, libraries, classrooms, professors, etc.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Academic excellence</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Colleges with a high degree of autonomy have a more responsible and accountable culture. Autonomous educational institutions offer high-quality education to pupils through their moral and verified academic achievement records, which include high pass rates and superior instruction. Their autonomy and adaptability allow them to take tremendous responsibility for the judgments they make in the administrative and academic spheres.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Governance and Administration</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Autonomous institutions benefit from all forms of certification and excellent rankings, including NIRF, NBA, NAAC, and others. The NIRF shows that autonomy can be persuasively used to improve college performance in India. The NIRF ranking provides information on the beneficial effects of autonomy on institutional efficacy and academic excellence. Strong governance and leadership structures are brought to institutions by self-governing authority.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Curriculum and Innovation</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Autonomous institutions can modify their curricula to accommodate changing industry and student demands. The curriculum\u2019s creative, current design has the potential to inspire novel approaches to instruction. College autonomy is necessary to foster innovation and improve institutional quality.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Student Support Services</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Supportive services for students are available at autonomous institutes, including career counseling, extracurricular activities, career guidance, and partnerships with other educational institutions to advance student</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion\u00a0</h2>\r\n<p>Autonomous Institutes have self-governing authority and self-supporting criteria. Autonomous institutes can set up their administrative bodies and councils to formulate new courses and syllabi. They can prescribe the fees of courses at their level. <a href=\"https://collegedunia.com/college/9743-noida-institute-of-engineering-and-technology-niet-greater-noida\">Autonomous institutes</a> are affiliated with government Universities. An autonomous institute is free to adapt to society\u2019s changing requirements and expectations.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>Also Read About:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/what-makes-niet-the-no-1-engineering-college-in-delhi-ncr/\">Top 5 Btech Colleges in Delhi NCR</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/2024/06/17/cracking-the-code-why-niet-ranks-among-the-top-computer-engineering-colleges-in-up/\">Top Computer Engineering Colleges in UP</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/how-to-identify-the-top-10-engineering-colleges-for-b-tech-programs-in-greater-noida/\">Top 10 Private Engineering Colleges in Greater Noida</a></p>\r\n</div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>When it comes to higher education, students in India are increasingly looking for institutions that offer flexibility, industry relevance, and better career opportunities. An autonomous institute provides all these advantages, allowing students to engage with a dynamic curriculum and cutting-edge infrastructure. Let\u2019s explore what makes autonomous institutes unique and the benefits they offer.</p>\r\n<h2>What is an <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\"><b class=\"pt-0\"> Autonomous Institute? </b></a></h2>\r\n<p>An autonomous institute is a higher education institution that operates independently from its parent university in designing the curriculum, conducting examinations, and awarding degrees. While affiliated with a recognized university for formal degree recognition, autonomous institutes can revise syllabi and implement teaching methods that meet current industry standards.</p>\r\n<p>This autonomy allows the institute to tailor its courses to meet the evolving needs of the job market, ensuring that students are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge. These institutes are free from the rigid academic frameworks imposed by traditional universities, making them a flexible and forward-thinking choice for students.</p>\r\n<h2>Why a Flexible Curriculum is Important</h2>\r\n<p>One of the standout features of an autonomous institute is the flexibility in curriculum design. Unlike traditional universities, which may take years to update their syllabi, autonomous institutes frequently revise their courses to reflect industry changes and technological advancements. This means students receive an education that\u2019s theoretical and practical, aligning with real-world job requirements.</p>\r\n<p>This flexibility also extends to the method of assessment. Instead of relying solely on final exams, autonomous institutes employ continuous evaluation methods like assignments, projects, presentations, and internships. This approach fosters consistent learning and reduces the pressure of cramming for one major exam at the end of the year. As a result, students are better prepared to enter the workforce with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of their subjects.</p>\r\n<h2>Career Growth and Global Exposure</h2>\r\n<p>Studying at an autonomous institute also opens up more excellent career opportunities . Since the courses are designed to be industry-relevant, students are more likely to attract the attention of employers who are looking for graduates with updated skill sets. Autonomous institutes often collaborate with companies for internships, industrial training, and placement drives, giving students a direct path to employment.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, many autonomous institutes partner with international universities, providing students with opportunities to participate in exchange programs, global internships, and collaborative research. This global exposure enhances learning and expands students\u2019 career prospects across borders, preparing them for opportunities in the international job market.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, an autonomous institute offers numerous advantages, from flexible, industry-aligned curricula to better career opportunities and global exposure. By choosing an autonomous institute, students set themselves up for a future-ready education that opens doors to various career paths.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Studying at an autonomous institute offers several benefits, including a flexible curriculum, industry-relevant courses, and enhanced career opportunities. Unlike traditional universities, autonomous institutes can frequently update their syllabi to reflect the latest trends and technologies, making students more employable. These institutes also emphasise continuous assessment and practical learning, ensuring a deeper understanding of subjects. Many autonomous institutes, like <a href=\"https://collegedunia.com/college/9743-noida-institute-of-engineering-and-technology-niet-greater-noida\">NIET (Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology)</a>, provide strong industry partnerships, internships, and global exposure, giving students a competitive edge in the job market.

With hundreds of institutions claiming to be the best, finding your place among the top 5 btech colleges in Delhi feels overwhelming, right?</p>\r\n<p>Choosing the right engineering institute isn\u2019t just about rankings and fancy brochures. It\u2019s about finding the institution that will convert your potential into expertise that employers want.

Let\u2019s break down what actually matters when selecting from the best engineering colleges in Delhi.</p>\r\n<h3>Match Your Specialisation with Your Passion</h3>\r\n<p>Before looking at college rankings, get clear about which engineering branch aligns with your interests and strengths.</p>\r\n<p>Ask yourself: Do you love coding and software development?

Also, the low placement rates. Misleading salary statistics. Companies that visit but don\u2019t hire. Sound familiar?</p>\r\n<p>Don\u2019t just ask \u201cwhat percentage of students get placed?\u201d Instead, go deeper:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Which specific companies recruit from the campus?</li>\r\n<li>What roles are offered to graduates?</li>\r\n<li>What\u2019s the average starting salary for your chosen branch?</li>\r\n<li>Are placements concentrated in a few departments?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When researching the top 5 btech colleges in Delhi, look into their industry connections and how they prepare students for recruitment drives.</p>\r\n<h3>Faculty Expertise and Teaching Approach</h3>\r\n<p>The best technology becomes irrelevant without qualified teachers who can impart knowledge effectively.</p>\r\n<p>When evaluating the institutes, check:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Faculty qualifications and industry experience.</li>\r\n<li>Student-to-faculty ratio.</li>\r\n<li>Teaching methodology (practical vs. theoretical).</li>\r\n<li>Opportunities for mentorship and research.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>NIET Greater Noida distinguishes itself through its experienced faculty members who bring both academic credentials and real-world expertise to the classroom.</p>\r\n<h3>Infrastructure</h3>\r\n<p>Modern labs, equipped workshops, and tech-integrated classrooms aren\u2019t luxuries; they\u2019re necessities for proper engineering education.</p>\r\n<p>The best engineering colleges in Delhi invest in upgrading their infrastructure to match industry standards. This includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Department-wise specialized laboratories.</li>\r\n<li>Innovation centers and maker spaces.</li>\r\n<li>Digital libraries and online resources.</li>\r\n<li>Campus-wide high-speed internet connectivity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Location and Industry Connect</h3>\r\n<p>Your college\u2019s location plays a huge role in your networking opportunities and internship possibilities. Delhi-NCR has a unique advantage with a concentration of tech companies, startups, and research institutions.</p>\r\n<p>NIET Greater Noida leverages its location in Greater Noida to build strong industry connections that translate into better opportunities for students.</p>\r\n<h2>Making Your Final Decision</h2>\r\n<p>Ready to stop feeling overwhelmed and start making progress? Follow these steps:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Shortlist based on your specialization.</li>\r\n<li>Visit campuses if possible (virtual tours if not).</li>\r\n<li>Talk to current students and alumni.</li>\r\n<li>Evaluate scholarship and financial options.</li>\r\n<li>Research student life and extracurricular activities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Remember, the right engineering institute doesn\u2019t just prepare you for your first job; it lays the foundation for your entire career.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Choosing from the <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/blog/what-makes-niet-the-no-1-engineering-college-in-delhi-ncr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top 5 btech colleges in Delhi </a> is a big decision that shapes your professional future.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>In today\u2019s dynamic business landscape, bridging marketing and finance is essential for MBA students. If you are aiming to join one of the top MBA colleges for marketing in India, it\u2019s important to understand how these two disciplines complement each other. At top MBA colleges in India like NIET, students are equipped with the skills to merge creativity in marketing with the precision of financial analysis, setting the foundation for a successful career in business leadership.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Understand the Fundamental Relationship Between Marketing and Finance</h2>\r\n<p>Marketing and finance are intertwined more closely than many realize. Marketing strategies generate revenue, but finance is what ensures that these strategies are sustainable. At top MBA colleges for marketing in India, students learn the importance of managing marketing budgets effectively while ensuring campaigns provide measurable financial outcomes. Understanding this relationship is crucial for aspiring business leaders.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Master Financial Metrics Relevant to Marketing</h2>\r\n<p>To successfully combine marketing and finance, it\u2019s important to understand key financial metrics that measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts. Here are some crucial metrics to focus on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \u2013 The cost to acquire a customer through marketing efforts.</li>\r\n<li>Lifetime Value (LTV) \u2013 The total value a customer brings to the company during their relationship.</li>\r\n<li>Return on Investment (ROI) \u2013 A metric that helps assess the profitability of marketing campaigns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At top MBA colleges in India like NIET, students receive hands-on experience in analyzing these financial metrics, enabling them to make informed decisions that benefit both the marketing and finance departments.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Leverage Data Analytics to Bridge the Gap</h2>\r\n<p>Data is at the core of both marketing and finance. In today\u2019s digital world, marketing strategies are heavily data-driven. Similarly, financial decision-making relies on data to forecast revenues and expenditures. As an MBA student, it\u2019s essential to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Learn how to interpret marketing data through tools like Google Analytics, social media insights, and CRM systems.</li>\r\n<li>Use financial data to assess the success of marketing campaigns, ensuring strategies are both cost-effective and profitable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At top MBA colleges for marketing in India, students get exposure to various data analytics tools and platforms, bridging the gap between marketing strategies and financial planning.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Develop Financial Literacy for Marketing Decisions</h2>\r\n<p>Marketing professionals often focus on creativity and consumer engagement, but financial literacy is equally important. As an MBA student, you should focus on understanding:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Financial statements and their role in evaluating marketing campaigns.</li>\r\n<li>Budget allocation for marketing efforts and how to justify them with expected financial returns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>By gaining financial literacy, you\u2019ll be able to make sound decisions regarding resource allocation, ensuring that marketing campaigns are not only innovative but also financially sustainable. NIET, among the top MBA colleges for marketing in India, ensures that students develop a solid foundation in financial knowledge along with marketing strategies.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Work on Cross-Departmental Collaboration</h2>\r\n<p>In any successful business, marketing and finance teams need to collaborate effectively. As an MBA student, seek out opportunities to work on projects that require input from both marketing and finance. Here are a few examples of cross-functional collaboration:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Joint Marketing-Finance Projects \u2013 Work on budgeting for marketing campaigns, evaluating financial outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Strategic Decision-Making \u2013 Participate in discussions where marketing\u2019s revenue generation is evaluated alongside financial constraints.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At top MBA colleges in India, projects that require input from multiple departments help you develop practical experience in managing both marketing and finance teams, preparing you for leadership roles.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Understand the Importance of Financial Forecasting for Marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Marketing strategies don\u2019t operate in a vacuum; they require financial forecasting. When planning campaigns, it\u2019s important to consider:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Projected costs of the campaign.</li>\r\n<li>Expected returns, based on previous data and financial analysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Top MBA colleges in India, such as NIET, help students develop forecasting skills, teaching them how to project the financial impact of marketing strategies and make adjustments based on financial objectives.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Adapt to Emerging Trends in Marketing and Finance</h2>\r\n<p>Marketing and finance are evolving fields. Digital marketing strategies are constantly changing, as are financial regulations and tools. As an MBA student, it\u2019s essential to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stay updated on the latest digital marketing trends, such as AI-powered analytics, influencer marketing, and content marketing.</li>\r\n<li>Be aware of changes in financial management tools, investment strategies, and ROI measurement techniques.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At top MBA colleges for marketing in India, students have access to the latest industry trends, helping them stay ahead in both fields.</p>\r\n<h2>8. Internships and Real-World Experience</h2>\r\n<p>The best way to truly understand the integration of marketing and finance is through hands-on experience. Seek internships or live projects that allow you to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Work on real-world marketing campaigns while tracking financial results.</li>\r\n<li>Participate in budget planning for marketing and evaluate the financial impact of different marketing strategies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>NIET, among the <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top MBA colleges for marketing</a> in India, provides excellent opportunities for internships and projects, ensuring that students are industry-ready upon graduation./p&gt;</p>\r\n<h2>9.

    "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p><span>In the world of business education, one question often stands out: What\u2019s the real difference between a PGDM and an <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/mba\">MBA</a>, and which one offers better career growth? Both programs are designed to shape future business leaders, but their structure, approach, and industry relevance can differ.</span></p>\r\n<p>For every ambitious college student aiming for leadership, entrepreneurship, or global management roles, understanding the PGDM vs MBA comparison is crucial before choosing the right program.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding the Difference Between PGDM and MBA</h2>\r\n<p>The PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) is typically offered by Autonomous colleges and institutions approved by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). These programs have the flexibility to update their curriculum regularly, keeping pace with changing industry trends.</p>\r\n<p>The MBA (Master of Business Administration), on the other hand, is a degree program offered by universities or colleges affiliated with them. While it provides a strong academic foundation, its curriculum may be updated less frequently compared to PGDM.</p>\r\n<p>In essence, while both focus on management education, the PGDM emphasizes industry application and practical learning, whereas the MBA emphasizes academic theory and structured frameworks.</p>\r\n<h2>Course Structure and Learning Approach</h2>\r\n<p>When comparing PGDM vs MBA, the difference in course structure becomes evident:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>PGDM:</strong> Designed with flexibility, PGDM programs often integrate the latest case studies, management tools, and technology trends.

Since Autonomous colleges are not bound by university regulations, they can quickly integrate emerging business trends such as Artificial Intelligence in management, digital marketing, fintech, and data analytics into the curriculum.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, an MBA follows a standardized university syllabus, which ensures consistency but can sometimes lack the agility needed to adapt to fast-changing global business practices.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, when it comes to aligning education with real-world expectations, PGDM often has the edge.</p>\r\n<h2>Career Opportunities and Placement Growth</h2>\r\n<p>Both PGDM and MBA open doors to diverse career paths in business, finance, consulting, marketing, and operations. However, their focus areas slightly differ:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>PGDM:</strong> Graduates are often preferred by corporates for roles requiring immediate decision-making and industry exposure. The hands-on experience gained through internships and live projects gives them a competitive edge in managerial positions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>MBA:</strong> Graduates with an MBA degree can pursue academic roles, research, or leadership positions in well-established organizations that value structured business education.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Skill Development and Practical Exposure</h2>\r\n<p>One of the biggest distinctions in the PGDM vs MBA debate lies in how students develop professional competencies.</p>\r\n<p>PGDM programs encourage learning through case studies, simulations, group discussions, and corporate mentoring, preparing students to handle real-world challenges confidently.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, MBA programs are ideal for students who prefer an academic and research-oriented approach, focusing on theoretical understanding and conceptual clarity.</p>\r\n<p>The PGDM model, however, aligns closely with the needs of modern employers who prioritize adaptability, innovation, and problem-solving over traditional knowledge retention.</p>\r\n<h2>Why NIET Is a Preferred Choice for Management Aspirants</h2>\r\n<p><span>As a leading Autonomous college, <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">NIET</a> bridges the gap between academic excellence and industry relevance through its advanced PGDM program. The institution focuses on holistic management education, ensuring students are well-prepared for global business challenges.</span></p>\r\n<p>Here\u2019s what makes NIET stand out:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Industry-integrated curriculum:</strong> The program is continuously updated to reflect the latest management practices and trends.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Practical learning environment:</strong> Students gain hands-on experience through internships, live projects, and corporate simulations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Expert faculty:</strong> Courses are guided by experienced academicians and industry professionals who bring real-world insights to the classroom.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Strong placement record:</strong> NIET\u2019s corporate collaborations ensure students secure placements in top multinational companies with competitive packages.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Entrepreneurial development:</strong> NIET encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, helping students turn their business ideas into reality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Global Recognition and Career Advancement</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to global recognition, both PGDM and MBA hold value. However, the MBA degree, being university-affiliated, often enjoys wider international acceptance. That said, many PGDM programs offered by reputed Autonomous colleges like NIET are equivalent to MBA degrees and highly regarded by employers both in India and abroad.</p>\r\n<p>The key difference lies in the outcome: PGDM graduates often enter the workforce with a stronger industry orientation, while MBA graduates have a solid academic grounding that can lead to doctoral studies or academic careers.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p><span>When choosing between PGDM vs <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/course/mba\">MBA</a>, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. Both courses offer valuable insights and career opportunities; the right choice depends on a student\u2019s goals and preferred learning style.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>If you\u2019re an aspiring college student looking to gain industry exposure, develop leadership skills, and achieve faster career growth, a PGDM program from an Autonomous college like <a href=\"https://www.niet.co.in/\">NIET</a> can be an ideal choice.<span></span></span></p>\r\n<p>NIET\u2019s innovative teaching approach, corporate partnerships, and focus on employability make it a top destination for students aiming to build successful management careers.</p>\r\n</div>",
