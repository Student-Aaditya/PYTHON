By merging many national markets into one global market, globalization increases the competitive pressures faced by an individual, companies and societies. Due to globalization, organizational transformation is taking place in various sectors. It is a challenging issue for the dynamic business environment to look for competent and creative professionals.</p>\r\n<p>The students at NIET are well-equipped to perform effectively in any environment. They have been groomed to be experts in their respective fields with leadership qualities, positive attitude, loyalty, and integrity to the organization. The institute has made a special provision for the personality development of its students and for enriching their communication skills by establishing a separate school for this task. Additionally, the Career Management Cell, works hard continuously for the proper placement of students in reputed companies and it has been showcasing encouraging results. Positive thinking, hard and dedicated work will enable our students to open the doors of success to whichever venture they aspire to enter.</p>\r\n<p>Well, action speaks louder than words and we are a good example for this maxim. We have been awarded many accolades for the placements we provide to our students. These awards prove the quality of the overall development that we have been imparting to the students.</p>\r\n<p>My best wishes to all the members of the NIET family.</p>\r\n<p>\"To treat the patients and to impart education both are divine works\"</p>\r\n</div>",

Today, education is much more than that \u2013 after all, if it is just knowledge that you are after there is enough of it and more on the World Wide Web. It has been estimated that the entire body of knowledge is doubling about every three years. To keep pace with this explosive growth is quite impossible.</p>\r\n<p>Educating youth without placement assistance is of no use today, which is why NIET Career Management Cell is working proactively in assisting students for various current and future prospective job opportunities. We organize our facilities to train &amp; place students as per their aptitude and follow the principle that \u201ceducation can't be used to its fullest without placements\u201d and work around this principle.</p>\r\n<p>In these changing times, the skills required by the professionals managing the industry are also changing. This is where NIET has pitched in. Since its inception, we at NIET have been striving hard to impart the requisite knowledge and inculcate a new set of skills and attitude in our students, keeping in mind the latest developments taking place globally. Our biggest strength lies in being proactive in learning the real world applications of concepts by interacting with the industry in the form of industrial visits, seminars, internships, and live projects.</p>\r\n<p>The arrangement ensures that the students give their best. This has helped to inculcate in the students a mindset that prepares them for the challenging corporate world. I am proud of what we at NIET have achieved within a short span of time and look at the future with optimism and confidence.</p>\r\n<p>I wish a very successful career ahead to all the students of NIET and feel confident that they will make significant contributions to the organizations they join.</p>\r\n</div>",

So, we are glad to present batches of professionals in varied disciplines from Noida Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology (NIET), who have it in them to survive as well as flourish in this competitive world with confidence and zeal, to grow and let the organizations, where they serve, to transcend new heights of success.</p>\r\n<p>Pyramid Finishing School provides training to the students according to the industry requirements, giving individual student a 360 degree improvement, not only in the areas like life skills, technical skills but also exposing the students to time management, teamwork, and project management. In the pioneer study conducted at NIET, it was observed in the study that the population (those who studied this amalgamated curricula), when they reached their fifth and seventh semesters, to face the placement drives, showed a stupendous rise in placement figures by 400% as compared to the control group (those who were not subjected to the additional finishing school curriculum). As a diamond acquires its true worth after experiencing immense heat and hard times, our students have attained their true worth after rigorous training, assiduous preparation and dedication. They are sincere, committed, with clear academic as well as career orientation.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, in the existing high velocity churning of engineering students, there is an emerging need to bridge the industry \u2013 academia gap to improve the quality of students and make them industry ready. In order to address this need, we at NIET, have organized many HR conclaves to discuss the future trends and nurture the leaders for tomorrow. Further enhancing our relationship with industry, the institute has also made e-ups with MNCs like Microsoft, Oracle, KPMG, ICICI Direct and Prometric. These e-ups not only promise to enhance student employability by a manifold, but also take the lead in encouraging 'innovative' learning like never before.</p>\r\n<p>Due to their sincerity and devotion, the demand for our students has been constantly on the rise. We are confident of receiving the same kind of overwhelming support from the prospective employer.</p>\r\n</div>",

Today, education is much more than that \u2013 after all, if it is just knowledge that you are after there is enough of it and more on the World Wide Web. It has been estimated that the entire body of knowledge is doubling about every three years. To keep pace with this explosive growth is quite impossible.</p>\r\n<p>Educating youth without placement assistance is of no use today, which is why NIET Career Management Cell is working proactively in assisting students for various current and future prospective job opportunities. We organize our facilities to train &amp; place students as per their aptitude and follow the principle that \u201ceducation can't be used to its fullest without placements\u201d and work around this principle.</p>\r\n<p>In these changing times, the skills required by the professionals managing the industry are also changing. This is where NIET has pitched in. Since its inception, we at NIET have been striving hard to impart the requisite knowledge and inculcate a new set of skills and attitude in our students, keeping in mind the latest developments taking place globally. Our biggest strength lies in being proactive in learning the real world applications of concepts by interacting with the industry in the form of industrial visits, seminars, internships, and live projects.</p>\r\n<p>The arrangement ensures that the students give their best. This has helped to inculcate in the students a mindset that prepares them for the challenging corporate world. I am proud of what we at NIET have achieved within a short span of time and look at the future with optimism and confidence.</p>\r\n<p>I wish a very successful career ahead to all the students of NIET and feel confident that they will make significant contributions to the organizations they join.</p>\r\n</div>",

The promising force that can help the organizations to survive and grow in such an environment, by effectively coping with the ever-changing demands, is the human resources with a \u201ccan do\u201d outlook. So, we are glad to present batches of professionals in varied disciplines from Noida Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology (NIET), who have it in them to survive as well as flourish in this competitive world with confidence and zeal, to grow and let the organizations, where they serve, to transcend new heights of success.</p>\r\n<p>Pyramid Finishing School provides training to the students according to the industry requirements, giving individual student a 360 degree improvement, not only in the areas like life skills, technical skills but also exposing the students to time management, teamwork, and project management. In the pioneer study conducted at NIET, it was observed in the study that the population (those who studied this amalgamated curricula), when they reached their fifth and seventh semesters, to face the placement drives, showed a stupendous rise in placement figures by 400% as compared to the control group (those who were not subjected to the additional finishing school curriculum). As a diamond acquires its true worth after experiencing immense heat and hard times, our students have attained their true worth after rigorous training, assiduous preparation and dedication. They are sincere, committed, with clear academic as well as career orientation.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, in the existing high velocity churning of engineering students, there is an emerging need to bridge the industry \u2013 academia gap to improve the quality of students and make them industry ready. In order to address this need, we at NIET, have organized many HR conclaves to discuss the future trends and nurture the leaders for tomorrow. Further enhancing our relationship with industry, the institute has also made e-ups with MNCs like Microsoft, Oracle, KPMG, ICICI Direct and Prometric. These e-ups not only promise to enhance student employability by a manifold, but also take the lead in encouraging 'innovative' learning like never before.</p>\r\n<p>Due to their sincerity and devotion, the demand for our students has been constantly on the rise. We are confident of receiving the same kind of overwhelming support from the prospective employer.</p>\r\n</div>",
