As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like- critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication, lifelong learning etc. IDEA Lab can empower the students and faculty to \u201cengage, explore, experience, express and excel\u201d, addressing the need of new age learning. IDEA Lab would serve as an infrastructure for faculty to take up and promote multidisciplinary education and research. Accordingly, faculty would be encouraged to get trained in these Labs and strive for creating problems/ projects/ internships in their own subjects/ disciplines and mentor the students.IDEA Lab at NIET established in collaboration with AICTE and DROISYS.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"lab_logos\">\r\n<li><span><img src=\"SITE_URLassets/frontend/images/aicte-logo.webp\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"aicte\"></span></li>\r\n<li><span><img src=\"SITE_URLassets/frontend/images/logo-droisys.webp\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"droisys\"></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-5\">\r\n<div class=\"blu-bg-cont\">\r\n<div class=\"stu-walfr-ttl niet\">\r\n<h4>Vision for IDEA Lab</h4>\r\n<p>To foster an ecosystem of Digital Factory for testing, validation and transformation of ideas into products to support mission AtmaNirbhar Bharat</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\" alumni_section faculty-t stu\">\r\n<div class=\"container_lg\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-7\">\r\n<div class=\"alumni_main_content_two\">\r\n<div class=\"stu-walfr-ttl niet\">\r\n<h4>Integration of IDEA Lab with existing facilities</h4>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The institute has well developed facilities in compliance with Industry 4.0 requirements.

Few industry experts are of the opinion that Artificial Intelligence is closely connected to popular culture thus driving the people to have improbable expectations and unrealistic fears about how it will alter the life and workplace in general. AI is spreading throughout various industries. Some of them include education, healthcare, banking, finance, and many more.</p>\r\n<p>Industries that have adopted AI on a bigger level are more from the service industry. Even industries like web design and development being impacted by AI in a huge manner. For instance, many web design and development agencies are making use of AI for coming up with more sophisticated website designs and automated codes that help them scale the speed of

theoretically be able to help with efficiency and compensate for human errors while supplementing our strengths. Machine learning is the capability of computers to learn new information without someone giving specific instructions to them. They learn by analyzing patterns and data, rather than someone programming them. Artificial intelligence can potentially simulate human-like patterns of thinking, but emotions are thought to be exclusively-biological.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
