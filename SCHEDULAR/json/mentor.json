Founded Galgotias Center for Experiential Learning Innovation and Incubation (GCELI2) as founder president. At GCELI2, Dr S Pratap has developed two experimental setup towards experiential learning and one experimental setup of BAN.</p>\r\n<p>He is working on various innovations out of which two prototypes are ready for launch of pilot projects. In addition, five innovations are in progressive stage. He has published twenty five research papers in reputed journals of IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, and Taylor\u2019s &amp; Francis apart from many more Scopus indexed research papers through different international conferences. He has also published two IPR (three more are under publication) from India and one book chapter \u2018\u2018Multimedia Nano Communication for Healthcare\u2013Noise Analysis\u201d, Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT), Academic Press, Elsevier. Dr. S Pratap has more than 20 years of experience in research innovation, and academics. The goal of his life is to implement an MNC and/or EMNC system, the application of which ranges from military to medical, information communication to bioinformatics and industry to environment, in short, almost in every aspect of life. His current research interests include modeling, analysis, and mitigation of fading, interference and noise in Wireless Communication and in Nano Communication, which includes Electromagnetic Nano Communication (EMNC) using terahertz band and Molecular Nano Communication (MNC) using molecules via gaseous or aqueous medium. He is a fellow of IETE, India, member of IEEE and member of GISFI, India.</p>",
